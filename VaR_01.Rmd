# Variance Covariance method
## 1) Calculate periodic returns of the stocks in the portfolio
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
# import fix_yahoo_finance as yf
import numpy as np
import datetime as dt
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import date
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
# Create our portfolio of equities
tickers = ['AAPL','META', 'C', 'DIS']

# Set the investment weights (I arbitrarily picked for example)
weights = np.array([.25, .3, .15, .3])

# Set an initial investment level
initial_investment = 1000000

# Download closing prices
data = yf.download(tickers, start="2020-02-01", end="2020-03-20")['Close']

#From the closing prices, calculate periodic returns
returns = data.pct_change()
returns.tail()
```
```{python}
## 2) Create a covariance matrix based on the returns
cov_matrix = returns.cov()
cov_matrix

## 3) Calculate the portfolio mean and standard deviation
avg_rets = returns.mean()
# Calculate mean returns for portfolio overall, 
# using dot product to 
# normalize individual means against investment weights
port_mean = avg_rets.dot(weights)

# Calculate portfolio standard deviation
port_stdev = np.sqrt(weights.T.dot(cov_matrix).dot(weights))

# Calculate mean of investment
mean_investment = (1+port_mean) * initial_investment

# Calculate standard deviation of investmnet
stdev_investment = initial_investment * port_stdev
```

```{python}
## 4) Calculate the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution (PPF) with a specified confidence interval, standard deviation, and mean
conf_level1 = 0.05 

# Using SciPy ppf method to generate values for the
# inverse cumulative distribution function to a normal distribution
# Plugging in the mean, standard deviation of our portfolio
# as calculated above
from scipy.stats import norm
cutoff1 = norm.ppf(conf_level1, mean_investment, stdev_investment)

## 5) Estimate the value at risk (VaR) for the portfolio by subtracting the initial investment from the calculation in step 4
var_1d1 = initial_investment - cutoff1
var_1d1

print('Here we are saying with 95% confidence that our portfolio of 1M USD will not exceed losses greater than $',var_1d1,'USD over a one day period.' )

# Over N days tem period 
# Below we can easily do that by just taking our 1 day VaR and multiplying 
# it by the square root of the time period (this is due to the fact that the 
# standard deviation of stock returns tends to increase with the square root of time).
# Calculate n Day VaR
var_array = []
num_days = int(15)
days = range(0,15)
for x in range(1, num_days + 1):    
    var_array.append(np.round(var_1d1 * np.sqrt(x),2))
    print(str(x) + " day VaR @ 95% confidence: " + str(np.round(var_1d1 * np.sqrt(x),2)))

# Build plot
plt.xlabel("Day #")
plt.ylabel("Max portfolio loss (USD)")
plt.title("Max portfolio loss (VaR) over 15-day period")
plt.plot(dvar_arrayays, '-r')
plt.show()
