Highlight [page 3]: As a family owned and managed business, the shareholding directors, together with the other directors, are central to the day to day running of the Company and because we are a private, family owned business, the long term success of the Group as a whole is always at the heart of what we do. Following its publication in December 2018, The Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies ("the Wates Principles") was adopted by the Board as a corporate governance code of conduct, as it aligns closely with our existing principles and approach to management. Our decisions are informed by our daily interactions with employees, customers and suppliers. We actively encourage feedback and communicate key developments in the business to our employees. Throughout the year, the Group's priorities in dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19 and related supply chain pressures were, and continue to be, to ensure the safety of our customers and colleagues, support our suppliers and maintain the availability of food and household essentials. Whether they work in a distribution centre, a retail shop or an·office, Farmfoods people are trusted to take responsibility for their work and to have control of delivering a great value, simple and friendly operation in a safe environment. We form good relations with both long established and new suppliers who appreciate our simple, flexible and honest approach to doing business, while our customers trust us to provide the best value on the food they enjoy and on the household essentials they need. We work hard to keep things simple and we eliminate wasted cost wherever we find it. We are mindful of the impact our operations may have on the environment and aim to reduce this impact wherever possible. Farmfoods
