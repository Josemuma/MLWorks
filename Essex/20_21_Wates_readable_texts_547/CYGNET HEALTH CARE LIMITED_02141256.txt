(QUAR-t'-'.LY QJIJ,J.:l[JIL\ ■ ■ At the end of 2021, a Board Secretary was appointed to provide advice, support and development of the Executive Management Board. This newly created role reports into Cygnet's CEO and the UHS Main Board and will support communication between the Board and its stakeholders. All Cygnet companies are governed by a set of board protocols initially agreed between UHSand the Cygnet directors. Directors Responsibilities' The board makes use of committees, as detailed above, to help with the consideration of matters such as financial reporting, risk, remuneration and quality. Each committee is conducted through its own terms of reference which are reviewed regularly. The board retains responsibility for any final decisions. Opportunity and Risk Quality and safety are at the forefront of everything we do and we continually monitor and review our services through our internal Quality Assurance, Safeguarding, Compliance and specialist teams. Our processes and systems give us visibility to manage performance, hear feedback, learn lessons and regulate the quality of care provided. In 2021 we appointed a new Director of Risk to oversee risk and safety issues across the organisation through effective management systems, transparent reporting processes and collaboration with external agencies as required. Each service has its own local risk register and governance arrangements that feed up into regional and corporate framework to ensure transparency and provide a clear line of sight from Board to ward/service and vice versa. Remuneration Cygnet's remunerations committee helps to ensure appropriate and fair levels of remuneration help to secure and retain high-quality directors, managers and clinical and non-clinical staff.
