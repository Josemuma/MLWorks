Reporting against the Wates Principles is included in the Corporate Governance Statement below. â€¢ Corporate Governance Statement For the year ended 31 December 2021, under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Group has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. The Directors have set out below an explanation of how the Wates Principles have been applied during the year. Principle 1 - Purpose and Leadership The Directors of the Company together with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are considered the Main Board ("Main Board"). The Main Board engages with the wider executive team (''the Executive Team ") a team that is made up of key leaders in the Company who have accountability and responsibility of a defined operational or compliance role. The Main Board actively engages with the Executive Team in setting the intentions and purpose of the Company. The Company is a unique hotel owner operator. It owns all 33 hotels in the UK and is able to assess full control over its operations. The Company's strategy is to provide customers with a complete 'all-in-one' experience through its exceptional hotel rooms, a food and beverage offering of a pub and grill and a coffee shop and a full leisure facility and gym complete with a swimming pool. It also offers a co-working space in a number of its hotels. The Company champions. the wellbeing of its employees and having a positive impact on the communities it operates in.

The Group has a Corporate Governance Policy that enables it to manage and identify who can report to the . Board and can deal more effectively with the challenges of running a group. The intention of the Corporate Governance Policy is to ensure that the business has appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interest of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. It includes the processes by which the Group's objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social regulatory and market environment. It is concerned with practices and procedures for trying to make sure the Group can achieve its objectives but ensure that stakeholders can have confidence that the trust in the Group is well founded. The Group's Senior Executive Team is composed of a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Financial Controller, Director of People and Operations and General Counsel. Members of the Senior Executive Team usually attend Main Board Meetings three times each year as required, and minutes are taken in line with statutory obligations. The Executive Team meets once a week to discuss performance, risk and highlight areas for discussion. The Executive Team has a diverse range of skills and expertise in the wide range of services offered by the Group from Food & Beverage to Leisure to Sales and Marketing to in-house financial and legal expertise. The Executive Team's size and composition is regarded as appropriate to the Group's complex yet focused business.

Principle 3 - Leadership responsibilities Each member of the Executive Team understands what they are accountable and responsible for and they provide a report each week at the Executive Team meeting. To ensure full transparency a monthly report is sent to the Main Board.

A Senior Risk Committee (comprising CEO, CFO, General Counsel and Director of People and Operations) meets twice a year.

The Group understands that a better sustainable future is within its reach and wants to play a significant part in getting there. The Group recognises that an essential part of being a responsible business is caring for the environment.

The Group has numerous policies in place to drive and assist this which focus on specific operations and how it can mitigate its current impact on the environment. The Group believes, linked to its environmental principles, that in order to achieve its aim to become a more sustainable business, it must also consider the wider community that each hotel operates in, and Village Green initiatives encompass this approach.
