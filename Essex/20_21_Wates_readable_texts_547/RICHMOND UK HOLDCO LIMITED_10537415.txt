Highlight [page 12]: Corporate governance The Group continues to operate under the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for large private companies. The Group's values, strategy and culture are driven by the Board of directors of the Company (the 'Board') and centred on our purpose, as demonstrated throughout the Strategic Report and Directors' Report. The Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of this annual report specifically shows our assessment of present and future risk. Board composition and responsibilities are disclosed on pages 23, 24 and 29. The roles of the Remuneration Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Health, Safety and Security Committee each of which directly support the Board, are discussed on page 25.

The directors confirm their ongoing adherence to sl 72(1) of the Companies Act 2006 and the directors' duty to promote the success of the Group for the benefit of its members as a whole. The Chief Executive Officer's review demonstrates our consideration of likely long-term consequences of decisions on all stakeholders and the Directors' Report shows our desire to maintain our high standards of business conduct, with specific interests and engagement of stakeholders discussed on pages 25 to 27.
