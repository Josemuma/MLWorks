There is a daily automated recon(iliation between the data warehouse and the general ledger and the Bank seeks to continually enhance these controls to ensure accuracy is maintained and to improve simplicity and transparency. The data used for reporting is also subject to both internal and external audit and provides assuranceto stakeholders that the data is free from material error or omission. External reviews are also periodically undertaken to provide further assuranceand recommend areasfor improvement or enhanced governance. External audit arrangements The Audit Committee has responsibility for managing the Bank's relationship with its external auditor, ensuring that at least every 10 years the external audit will be considered for re-tender.
