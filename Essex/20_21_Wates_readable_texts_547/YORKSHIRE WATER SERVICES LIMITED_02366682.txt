Highlight [page 87]: Corporate Governance Statement I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Statement for the year ended 31 March 2022. As a water utility we provide an essential public service to our local community. We are very aware of our obligations to our shareholders and other stakeholders, including our customers, suppliers, local authorities, regulators and to the environment,.on which we are dependent for our water resources now and in the future. we . al_ways want to do the right thing and be open and accountable at all times, operating with exceptional governance so that our stakeholders can rely on us. 路路This report describes how we have applied good governance principles in the way in which our Board and its supporting committees operate. It includes information on how we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Ofwat Board Leadership, Transparency and Governance Principles, and the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. During the year we have undertaken an externally facilitated Board evaluation, and we include the feedback from this in this report. ( I am ple路ased to report that this found that our Board and committees路continue to be effective and we show particular strength in our Board dynamics and the way in which our ~oard meetings are managed, which is key to maintaining good governance at Board level. Further information on the findings from our B.oard evaluation review are later in this section. As always, we welcome any feedback on our appro.ach to corporate governance and this can.be directed to our Compa~y Secretary, Kathy Smith, who can be contacted at compsec@yorkshirewater.co.uk
