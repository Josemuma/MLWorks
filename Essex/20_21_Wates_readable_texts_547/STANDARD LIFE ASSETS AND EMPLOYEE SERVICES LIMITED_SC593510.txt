Principle One: Purpose and L_eadership An effective board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. From a governance perspective, Board composition was adjusted during the year, thereby addressing a cross-directorship between the Company and its ultimate parent, Phoenix Group Holdings pie. The Board is an appropriate size given the scale and complexity of the Company, particularly as the Company's ultimate parent (Phoenix Group Holdings pie) and the Life Companies Board provide oversight of the Company's activities.
