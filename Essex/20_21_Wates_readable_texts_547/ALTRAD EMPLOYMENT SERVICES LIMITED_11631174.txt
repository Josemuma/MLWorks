Reporting against the Wates Principles is included in the Corporate Governance Statement below. Corporate Governance Statement For the year ended 31 August 2021, under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. The Directors have set out below an explanation of how the Wates Principles have been applied during the year. Principle 1 - Purpose and Leadership The Directors of Altrad Services Limited together with a wider management team ("the Leadership team") sets the Company's purpose and strategy, and are accountable to the Altrad Group ("Altrad") based in Montpellier, France. Altrad is a world leader in the provision of Industrial Services, and is made up of 42,000 people distributed across 50 countries operating across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Altrad's strategy is to bring value to its customers by providing diversified, high-quality services, with high ethical and safety standards, in several sectors, and a long-term vision of the market and its prospects. Altrad's activities range from project engineering to plant maintenance in sectors as varied as oil and gas (28 % of sales), electrical energy (11 %), process industries (25 %) and construction (36 %), including the manufacture of wheelbarrows and concrete mixers as well as scaffolding, for both sale and rental. The Company together with its Altrad affiliates are the UK's leading provider of support services. It enhances the lives of millions by supporting some the nation's most vital energy generating assets. It uses its ingenuity to get ahead, solving the nation's infrastructure challenges through innovation, creativity and teamwork. Principle 2 - Leadership composition Although the parent company is not listed on a stock exchange, Altrad's commitment to the principles of good governance to guarantee economic performance, exemplary administration and management, trust and transparency has led it to opt for a governance model that respects the principles of the Autorite des Marches Financiers(F~enchfinancial markets authority). The foundations of this governance system are transparency of financial information, risk management in accordance with the highest standards, and ethical rules, strengthening the independence of directors in relation to the President and providing shareholders with the best information and the greatest possible visibility. The Company's Leadership team comprises of a Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director, Director of Business Development & Strategy, two Managing Directors, Human Resources Director and a Commercial Director. The Leadership team has a diverse range of skills, expertise and over 175 combined years of experience in the oil & gas, petrochemical, nuclear and conventional and renewable power generation markets. The Leadership team size and composition is regarded as appropriate to the Company's large yet focused business. The members of the Leadership team have equal voting rights when making decisions, except the CEO, who has a casting vote. All members have access to the advice and services of Altrad's Legal Counsel and may, if they wish, take professional advice at the Company's expense. The Company is committed to creating an ever-more inclusive environment, thereby fostering a more diverse workforce with a greater breadth of experience and perspective including at the most senior levels. The Company has demonstrated its commitment to this area by establishing a UK Diversity and Inclusiveness committee in 2020 who set the strategy in this area, and who report to the leadership team throughout the year.

Highlight [page 8]: Principle 3 - Leadership responsibilities Each member of the Leadership team understands what they are accountable and responsible for and reports on a monthly basis. The Leadership team is further supported by an Operating Committee that meets: monthly. The Leadership team, whilst ultimately retaining responsibility for UK decision making, ensures delegated decision makers are individuals with the most experience and relevant knowledge. All members of the Leadership team are required to consider any conflicts or potential conflicts and declare them via an ethics and integrity portal as a minimum annually. Altrad operates a zero-tolerance approach to unethical business conduct and as a leading global organisation has a responsibility in the global fight against bribery and corruption. Altrad's business ethics and integrity framework provide a structured and effective means of managing ethical risks through controls, systems, training and audit programmes. Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk To ensure Altrad achieves its purpose, the Leadership team actively pursues opportunities, both reinvestment and development to fuel organic growth, and acquiring carefully selected businesses to bolster the Company's core operations or expand into complementary sectors. Altrad's mergers & acquisitions team identify acquisition targets and the potential synergies available and, in tandem with the Leadership team, performs comprehensive commercial, financial and legal due diligence. The Company published it's five year plan, "Altrad 2026 Strategy" in the year which is available to download on its website https://www.altradservices.com/our-approach/?section=strategy . By 2026, the Company and its affiliates will have grown by 75% in size and will continue to be the leading provider of support services in the UK. The growth journey will be driven by three strategic elements; Retain via client satisfaction and key account management; Develop by strategic bid management, organic growth and new skills & capabilities; Acquire through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Risk management involves an acceptance of a reasonable degree of risk, which no entrepreneurial business is without, within a governance framework that manages the risks to reduce the potential impact. Key business risks are monitored through the Company's matrix organisational structure with several levels of control and management. While Altrad maintains a global risk governance framework, the Company also has its individual risk management plan. This duplication enables a holistic, Group approach in combination with localised, country or market-specific assessments. The Company monitors and acts to mitigate risks on a weekly basis as required, whilst working within the Group formal risk framework. Within the Company, there is both a responsibility towards and a dependency on the people within the business. Their safety and wellbeing are the number one focus. The business is unequivocally committed to achieving excellence in safety, including supporting an environment and culture where this remains the number one priority throughout our operations. The Company defines safety as a condition of being; an output of performance which is driven through senior leadership responsib_ilityand accountability. The Company's leaders commit to inspire, enable and challenge in order to ensure complete dedication to the people within the business. This has been continually demonstrated during the current Covid-19 pandemic, and these beliefs, behaviours and attitudes are integral to the Company's safety model and intrinsically linked to accomplishing optimal safety performance. Principle 5 - Remuneration Altrad oversees the remuneration of the Leadership team, with market rate salaries to ensure retention coupled with short and long term incentive plans which are aligned to Altrad's purpose and the interests of stakeholders at both a UK and Group level. The Leadership team oversees the remuneration of the Company's people with certain changes requiring oversight and sign off by Altrad. A large proportion of the Company's people are paid in line with industry standards. â€¢ The Company is committed to creating a culture of excellence that not only enables employees to reach their full potential but also enables the Group to live up to its ambitions.
