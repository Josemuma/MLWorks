The Board has a skills matrix in place to ensure the composition of the Board contains the appropriate combination of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge to understand and guide the business.

The Board is comprised of both Non-Executive Directors, the majority of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors, and Executive Directors. The Board also has a Senior Independent Director. The Board is responsible for organising and directing the affairs of the Company in a manner that is most likely to promote the success of the Company for its shareholders as a whole and in a way that is consistent with its Articles of Association, applicable regulatory requirements and current corporate governance practice. The Board undertook a formal effectiveness review of its performance, the results of which were discussed by the Board in October 2021. The Board evaluation tracker was subsequently refreshed to include new actions arising from the 2021 evaluation process and will be updated on an ongoing basis and shared regularly with the Board. The next independent assessment will take place in 2022/2023. The 2021 Board Effectiveness Review assessed that overall the Company was operating effectively with a number of areas prioritised for focus during the coming year. Principle 3 - Director responsibilities The Company operates in accordance with the Aviva Governance Framework, as approved by Aviva pie. The Aviva Governance Framework articulates the interrelation between its purpose, culture, values; its reporting and escalation structures and their alignment with legal and regulatory duties and its risk management framework. The core elements are the legal and regulatory flow of accountability and decision making and the Company's frameworks, policies and standards and the checks and balances through the operation of the Company's 2nd and 3rd lines of defence which ensure effective Board oversight. Within the Aviva Group, accountability is formally delegated by the Board of the Company to the CEO and by the CEO to their direct reports. The CEO delegations are referenced in the Board's Terms of Reference. Accountability rests with these individuals and the Board. These accountabilities are aligned with the Senior Managers Certification Regime responsibilities. These roles and responsibilities are clearly documented in the Management Responsibility Maps which form part of our Governance Framework and which are submitted to the PRAand the FCAon a quarterly basis. The Company must also adhere to the Group's Subsidiary Governance Principles which are a set of internal governance principles. The Board held four quarterly meetings this year, plus a further 16 meetings to discuss specific items and one additional strategy session. The Board's key areas of focus in 2021 were responding to regulatory change including implementation of the FCAPricing Practices rules and responding to the consultation on Consumer Duty and the launch of AvivaZero. The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Risk Committee and a Conduct Committee. The Terms of Reference for these committees are aligned to those of Aviva pie and are approved annually by the Board. The committees also undertake annual effectiveness reviews. The results are discussed by the committee and an action plan is agreed, with the actions tracked by the Company Secretary. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Company's financial systems and controls and receive regular updates on the work of the Company's internal audit function and from its external auditors.

This oversight includes oversight of the Company's conduct framework including product design, live selling practices, claims practices, and conduct oversight of third parties The Committee's responsibilities include reviewing the Company's conduct and financial crime risk profile, and overseeing the brand and reputation of the Company, ensuring that reputation al risk is consistent with the risk tolerance approved by the Board and the creation of long-term shareholder value. Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk The role of the Board is to promote the long-term sustainable successof the company, generating value for its shareholder within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risks to be assessed and managed. The Company operates a risk management framework that forms an integral part of the management and Board processes and decision-making framework, aligned to the Group's risk management framework. The key elements of the risk management framework comprise risk appetite; risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes the Company uses to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of risk models and stress and scenario testing. The Company's position against its risk appetites and tolerances is monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis. Long-term sustainability depends upon the protection of franchise value and good customer relationships. As such, the Company has a risk preference that it will not accept risks that materially impair the reputation of the Company and requires that customers are always treated with integrity.
