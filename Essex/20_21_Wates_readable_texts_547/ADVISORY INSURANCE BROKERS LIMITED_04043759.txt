Highlight [page 10]: Corporate governance For the year ended 31 December 2021, under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. There have been no departures from the code in the current year.

Highlight [page 11]: Wates Principles The Board has reviewed the Wates principles and considers them to be relevant and appropriate for a regulated Company of our size and complexity rather than the UK Corporate Governance Code (which is more relevant for Listed companies). The Board considers it to be a matter of best practice to adopt and comply with a suitable governance code and has therefore approved the adoption of the Wates Principles. Further details of how the Company has applied the principles can be found in the strategic report of these financial statements in the s 172 statement.
