Highlight [page 91]: CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION I am pleased to introduce this report, which describes the activities of the Board during the year, along with Heathrow's governance arrangements. Heathrow's purpose is to give passengersthe best airport service in the world. In 2021, air travel has continued to be heavily affected by the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board has remained focused on taking the appropriate action to successfully guide Heathrow through this extended period of uncertainty and to ensure it is well positioned for a return in passenger demand. During this period, the safety and wellbeing of passengers and colleagues has remained paramount, and the Board has further focused on ensuring that the airport continues to operate safely. The Board has also focused on achieving a fair and appropriate regulatory settlement for the H7 regulatory period. Our robust governance framework has helped to support this work. 92 As a Board, we remain committed to high standards of corporate governance and believe that these high standards are central to the effective management of the HAHL Group and to maintaining the confidence of our investors. There were a number of changes to the Board during 2021. In June, we welcomed the appointment of Joan MacNaughton as a new Independent Non-Executive Director and the appointment of Luke Bugeja as a new Non-Executive Shareholder Director. We also said farewell to Jorge Gil Villen (Non-Executive Shareholder Director) in June and to David Begg (Independent Non-Executive Director) in November, both long-standing members of the Board who have contributed greatly to Heathrow. At the end of August, we bid farewell to Carol Hui (Chief of Staff and General Counsel) who was Company Secretary and thanked her for her commitment to the Board. We also welcomed the appointment of Mark Oliver (Interim General Counsel) as the new Company Secretary. The following pages provide information on the composition of the HAHL Board and its governance structure and processes,together with reports from each of its committees. For the year ended 31 December 2021, under the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the HAHL Group has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies, published by the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') in December 2018. The Wates Principles provide a framework for the HAHL Board to monitor corporate governance of the HAHL Group and see where governance standards can be raised to a higher level across the business. We believe this, in turn, will result in better engagement with our stakeholder base and ultimately build trust with our passengers, colleagues and investors. Governance processesare cascaded down from the HAHL Board to other companies in the HAHL Group, including the Directors of Heathrow (SP)Limited, so that the governance framework can provide the right environment for the HAHL Board, and other companies in the HAHL Group, to make decisions for the long-term success of Heathrow. The table below summarises the six Wates Principles and indicates where more information can be found in the strategic and the governance reports. Throughout 2022, the HAHL Board will continue to review and challenge how the HAHL Group can continue to improve its corporate governance.

Where appropriate, recommendations are made by each of the HAHL Board Committees so that final decisions can be taken by the HAHL Board. Members of the HAHL Board have the opportunity to attend monthly Board Working Group sessionsto receive more in-depth information about specific aspects of the business. The Board Working Group sessions are available to all Board members and their advisors and enable further discussion on particular topics ahead of Board meetings. • 94 The Executive Committee is the forum of the senior executive management team of the HAHL Group. The HAHL Board delegates authority for day-to-day management of the HAHL Group to the Executive Committee, which meets weekly and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.

The Executive Committee develops and recommends to the HAHL Board, medium and long-term business development strategies. They ensure the delivery of agreed strategies by providing guidance, approvals, governance and monitoring. The Executive Committee also considers health and safety, financial, legal and regulatory matters, risk assurance and compliance, and reviews and approves all matters to be presented to the HAHL Board for information or approval. There is a high level of interaction between the HAHL Board and the Executive Committee. Members of the Executive Committee provide presentations at board meetings on a regular basis and attend strategy days with the HAHL Board in order to review issues in more detail, plan and align views. The Executive Committee delegates specific matters to a number of formal sub-committees whilst retaining overall accountability. The sub-committees consist of managers and other experts with appropriate knowledge, industry experience and expertise to make decisions and report back to the Executive Committee. Each sub-committee operates in accordance with terms of reference approved by the Executive Committee and is evaluated on a regular basis.

* ~. r---·, --·, The names and biographies of all Directors of the HAHL Board are published on pages 86 to 89. Nine of the Non-Executive Shareholder Directors have formally approved alternates, who are also listed. The alternates are statutory Directors of HAHL, who attend Board and other meetings when Shareholder Non-Executive Directors are unable to do so, or they attend alongside the Shareholder Non-Executive Directors as observers. The Executive and Non-Executive Directors are equal members of the HAHL Board and have collective responsibility for the HAHL Group's strategy and performance. Each HAHL Board Director has a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. ,s. ::!! z J> z n > 11'1 E The Independent Non-Executive Directors bring outside experience in areas such as aviation, transport, health and safety, sustainability, climate change, energy, government and finance, and provide constructive challenge and influence from outside the HAHL Group. The Chairman holds periodic meetings with all the Non-Executive Directors to discuss Lhe performance of management and the HAHL Board, without the Executive Directors present. The HAHL Board considered the Chairman, Lord Paul Deighton, to be independent in judgment and character on his appointment on 22 June 2016. The Chairman and each of the Independent Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the HAHL Group rather than service contracts, which include the expected time commitment of the appointment. The Directors are required to comply with Heathrow's group policies, including policies on Professional Conduct, Health and Safety, Conflicts of Interest and Anti-Bribery, Gifts and Hospitality. The HAHL Board believe that its size and composition are appropriate to meet the strategic needs and challenges of the business and to enable effective decision-making. The composition of the HAHL Board is partly determined by the Shareholders' Agreement, which provides that each Shareholder controlling ten per cent or more of the issued ordinary shares of FGPTopco Limited, is entitled to appoint one Director to the HAHL Board. It is considered to be in the interests of the HAHL Group for each Shareholder to be represented on the HAHL Board. In addition, there are three Independent Non-Executive Directors whose purpose is to challenge and provide external expertise. The HAHL Board does not have a majority of Independent Non-Executive Directors and it is felt that the numbers associated with ensuring a majority of Independent Non-Executive Directors would make the operation of the HAHL Board unwieldy and unduly costly. It is acknowledged that, although there is international diversity on the HAHL Board, there is a relative lack of gender diversity. The HAHL Board is committed to making the HAHL Group an ever-more inclusive environment, thereby fostering a more diverse workforce which should increase diversity at the most senior levels.

Highlight [page 96]: Recommendations for the appointment of Directors to the HAHL Board are made by the Nominations Committee. Appointments are made on merit and against objective criteria with due regard to diversity (including skills, experience, age, gender, disability and social and ethnic background). Non-executive appointees are also required to demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role.

Highlight [page 99]: EFFECTIVENESS INDUCTION AND INFORMATION. A comprehensive induction programme is provided for all new HAHL Board Directors. Our Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the HAHL Group by regularly meeting with senior management, attending operational site visits, strategy sessions with the Executive Committee and regular training sessions. During the lock down period induction training sessions were conducted online. All HAHL Board Directors have access to the advice and servicesof the Company Secretary and the Heathrow Group's Legal team. They may also take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. To ensure that adequate time is available for Board discussion and to enable informed decision-making, briefing papers are prepared and circulated to Directors a week prior to scheduled HAHL Board meetings. The HAHL Board also receives regular and timely information (at least monthly) on all key aspects of the business, including health and safety, risks and opportunities, the financial performance of the business, strategy, operational matters, market conditions and sustainability, all supported by key performance indicators. During the COVID-19 pandemic the Board received regular updates on the passenger demand forecast and on the health, safety and wellbeing of colleagues and passengers. 100 Key financial information is collated from the Heathrow Group's various accounting systems. The HAHL Group's finance function is appropriately qualified to ensure the integrity of this information and is provided with the necessary training to keep up to date with regulatory changes. Statutory financial information is externally audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPon an annual basis, and financial controls are reviewed by the Group's internal audit function. Other key information is prepared by the relevant internal function. Processesfor collecting data, as well as the reporting of that data, are reviewed on a cyclical basis by the HAHL Group's internal audit function with quarterly reporting provided to the Audit Committee. BOARD EVALUATION The HAHL Board considers the regular review of its function, Committees and Directors to be an essential element of good corporate governance and important for identifying key areas of focus for future improvement and for strengthening its overall performance. Internal evaluation assessmentswere carried out in November 2020 and November 2021. The reviews were conducted by questionnaire, which sought the Directors' feedback on all aspects of Board and Committee performance, including board composition, behaviours and dynamics, the number and length of meetings, agendas, the quality of information, the Chairman's leadership and focus, strategic oversight, interaction between the Board and its committees, overview of risk, succession planning, induction and training and priorities for change. The results were collated by the Company Secretary and anonymised before being discussed with the Chairman and the Board for consideration and recommendations, with follow-up actions debated and adopted as appropriate. 2020 INTERNAL EVALUATION As reported in the 2020 Annual Report, an internal evaluation was undertaken during November 2020. The results were positive overall, with themes reflecting the testing environment imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and requirement to make difficult decisions about the business and adjust to new processes. HAHL Board and committee meetings continued to be held virtually which did not present any significant issues.The key areas identified for increased focus and development during the 2021 financial year are set out below: Areas of Focus Identified 1. Committee chairs to further improve reporting on their committees' activities to the HAHL Board, including reviewing their terms of reference. 2. To review the effectiveness of the Shareholder Working Group sessions, taking place outside of HAHL Board meetings. 3. To schedule more time for Non-Executive Directors to hold discussions without management present

Highlight [page 100]: 1. Further improvements have been made to the way in which each of the formal committee's report to the HAHL Board and all minutes and papers from the formal committees have been made available to HAHL Board members. Each of the committees' terms of reference were reviewed and approved during the year. 2021 INTERNAL EVALUATION An internal evaluation was undertaken during November 2021. Overall, there was a majority consensus that the Board was functioning well and was effective. The main themes reflected the continuing testing environment imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, airport readiness and ramping up the business for growth and the regulatory settlement. The Board continued to hold on-line meetings successfully during the year but acknowledged the benefits of returning to some physical meetings as soon as it was practical to do so. The key areas identified for increased focus and development during the 2022 financial year are set out below: Areas of Focus Identified 1. Committee chairs to continue to improve the interface and reporting between the formal committees and the Board. 2. To review the number and frequency of Board meetings and the balance of physical and on-line meetings. 3. To focus on the presentation of information to the Board to enable more time for discussion and debate. Individual evaluations were also carried out by each of the HAHL Board's formal committees in 2021. Overall, the reviews showed a consensus that the HAHL Board and its committees were functioning well and were effective. No material shortcomings in relation to the operation of the HAHL Board and its committees were highlighted by the reviews. The Chairman confirms that each Director continues to make a valuable contribution to the HAHL Board and, where relevant, its committees.

Highlight [page 100]: The monthly Shareholder Working Group sessions remain an effective forum for deep dives and discussion for regulatory, financial and other business issues, particularly when Board time is limited. The sessions are available to all Board members and have been re-named as the 'Board Working Group'. 2. Regular sessions have been made available before Board meetings for Non-Executive Director discussion without management present.

Hon Ruth Kelly INTRODUCTION I am pleased to present the Audit Committee (the 'Committee') report for the year ended 31 December 2021. During the year the Committee continued to play a key role in assisting the HAHL Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility. During 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic continued to create unprecedented impacts for Heathrow and the aviation industry as a whole. The financial, accounting and reporting implications have been significant and the role and accountability of the Committee to oversee, monitor, challenge and support management in ensuring quality and integrity in Heathrow's accounting and reporting practices has been critical during this time. During the year and at year end, the Committee's focus has been on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, which has increased the complexity and number of key judgements in the financial statements. Throughout the year the Committee reviewed key accounting judgements made by management in relation to going concern, expansion and asset and other impairment, and made recommendations to the HAHL Board in relation to these judgements. Considerable time was also spent monitoring the implementation of the Finance Transformation programme (Project Magenta), including assessing the implications and risks for external reporting at year end and ensuring that sufficient mitigations were in place during the 'go live' phase and beyond. The Finance team and our external auditors have adapted well to the restrictions imposed by remote working and management have worked hard to ensure that our financial controls have been maintained. 102 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Committee is a sub-committee of the HAHL Board, and its responsibilities include: • Considering the appointment of the external auditor, taking into account relevant ethical guidance and assessing the independence of the external auditor, ensuring that key audit personnel are rotated at appropriate intervals (including overseeing the process for selecting the external auditor and making recommendations to the HAHL Board). • Recommending the audit fee to the HAHL Board for approval and pre-approving any fees in respect of non-audit services provided by the external auditor and ensuring that the provision of non-audit services does not impair the external auditor's independence or objectivity. • Agreeing with the external auditor the nature and the scope of the audit and reviewing the auditor's quality control procedures and steps taken by the auditor to respond to changes in regulatory and other requirements. • Reviewing reports on the effectiveness of systems for internal financial control, financial reporting and risk management. • Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the HAHL Group, and reviewing and challenging, where necessary,the actions, accounting policies and key judgements and estimates of management in relation to the interim and annual financial statements, and any press release related to those statements. • Reviewing Internal Audit reports to the Committee on the effectiveness of the HAHL Group's systems for internal control, financial reporting and risk management. • Reviewing the external auditor's internal control recommendations and management's responses. • Considering management's response to any major external or internal audit recommendations. • Approving the appointment and discharge of the Director of Internal Audit, Risk and Assurance. • Reviewing Heathrow's procedures for handling allegations from whistleblowers. • Reviewing the ethics policy and monitoring its application throughout the business, considering any ethical issues which arise as a result of audit findings. • Overseeing all press releases relating to external financial results. • Reviewing Heathrow's tax policy and insurance strategy and arrangements. • Reviewing the results of the Data Protection Officer's data privacy compliance monitoring programme and ensuring that the Data Protection Office is adequately resourced to carry out its tasks. • Considering the adequacy of management's response to any major data privacy non-compliance findings as a result of monitoring activities. • Reviewing Internal Investigations and approving Internal Investigations Protocol. • Confirming that the financial statements are fair, balanced and understandable. • Review and confirmation of the going concern disclosure for the Annual Report and financial statements. • Considering any other topics, as defined by the HAHL Board.

Highlight [page 103]: KEY JUDGEMENTS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS The Committee reviewed critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty outlined in the 'Accounting policies' section of the financial statements. Based on the discussion with management, work and recommendation of the Group finance function and input from external auditor, the Committee considered that the most significant financial statements' risk matters are as follows: Matters Continued impact of COVID-19 on financial reporting matters COVID-19 has increased the complexity and number of key judgements in the financial statements. Going concern The Directors are required to determine that the business is a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report and financial statements. Assets held in the course of construction ('AICC') and probability of expansion The HAHL Group has a substantial capital programme which has been agreed with the regulator (the Civil Aviation Authority). Only those costs which satisfy the requirements of IAS16 'Property, Plant and Equipment' should be capitalised, which in some cases requires management judgement. Climate change and TCFD On the basis that it has been highlighted as a material risk, the Committee reviews disclosures relating to climate change and TCFD. It is also required to assesswhether climate change risks provide indication that an asset may be impaired. Audit Committee review and conclusions The Committee assessedthe effect of COVID-19 on financial reporting and control matters, with specific consideration of the following: • Effects of COVID-19 on the going concern assessment for the Group. • Consideration of the probability of expansion of the airport against the uncertainty created by COVID-19. • Impairment considerations across all assets held, taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on the forecasting and value of the Group. • Impact of the volatility changes in macroeconomic indicators due to COVID-19 on the fair value of the defined benefit pension scheme and investment properties. • Implications on the Group's internal control processes, including the challenges presented by remote working and a restructured workforce. The Committee agreed that Management had continued to take sufficient actions to ensure a robust control environment remained in place. Where management's judgement was required for the specific COVID-19 impacts listed above, the Committee's considerations and conclusions are detailed below. The Committee reviewed the assumptions and disclosure made in reaching the going concern conclusion including forecast operational cash flows, forecast capital expenditure, the overall group liquidity position, and impact on covenants and reviewed the output of the scenario testing performed, including severe but plausible downside scenarios. It was also noted that, in modelling the impact of COVID-19, there is a significant degree of uncertainty, given the evolving current environment and the wide range of potential forecasts being performed by various stakeholders in the global aviation industry. The Committee concluded it was appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis with material uncertainty. The Committee received regular updates of work undertaken by the Fixed Asset Steering Group, who are responsible for ensuring capitalised costs are appropriate. During the year, the Committee reviewed an impairment and write-off charge of £24 million on assets in the course of construction and £7 million on intangible assets. The Committee concluded that the total impairment charge recognised of £31m was appropriate. The Committee reviewed Management's judgement that it remains probable that expansion of the airport will continue and therefore it is appropriate to have recognised £513m of spend to date as an asset in the course of construction. The Committee noted that on 6 September 2021 the Secretary of State for Transport concluded that no review of the ANPS was necessary at this time, and that the CAA continued to support Expansion as outlined in its Initial Proposals published on the 19 October 2021. The Committee further noted that, although the current COVID-19 crisis is expected to delay the opening of the third runway, it remains Management's assessmentthat in the longer term, once the benefits of air travel and connectivity have been restored, an expanded Heathrow will be required, even with the long-term uncertainty of climate change on passenger demand. Nevertheless, it was also noted that uncertainty remained, including the incentives needed for investment and the overall response to the DCO application once it is submitted. As a result of the current delay, the Committee considered whether any of the existing assets were at risk of obsolescence due to the risk of re-work, noting that Management recognised an impairment of £10m in the prior year due to the delay, with no further amount recognised in the current year. Considering all factors in relation to expansion, including the legal and regulatory frameworks still in place, and noting the Board's continued support for the programme as evidenced by the reopening of the Interim Property Hardship Scheme in May 2021, the Committee agreed with Management and concluded it was probable expansion would occur. It therefore concluded it was appropriate to continue to recognise an asset in the course of construction, that no additional impairment was required at this time and that appropriate disclosures should be included in the financial statements. The Committee reviewed and approved the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in the Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee also considered whether there were any indicators of material impairment over property, plant and equipment, expansion assets in the course of construction, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries, investment properties and deferred tax assetsas a result of the potential physical and transition risks arising from climate change that were identified in the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures(TCFD). It was agreed that it was appropriate that no further impairments were recognised in the year as a result of this exercise.

Highlight [page 104]: Matters Impairment considerations - ongoing implications of COVID-19 At the end of each reporting period, the HAHL Group is required to assesswhether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Judgement is required in assessingthe impact of COVID-19 on forecasting and the value of assets in the Group. Fair value of investment properties The HAHL Group holds a variety of investment properties that are accounted for at fair value. In determining the fair value, judgement is required with regard to a number of valuation assumptions that include property rental growth rate, operating cost and expected yields. Valuation of the retirement benefit obligation The HAHL Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme with both open and closed sections. Assessing the defined benefit pension obligation requires significant estimate and judgement, in particular with regard to discount rate, inflation and mortality. Hedge accounting and IBOR reform The HAHL Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Significant changes in the expected quantum of future Sterling refinancing may lead to insufficient Sterling borrowings to support components of the cash flow hedge reserve, requiring the recycling of the cash flow hedge reserves through income statement. Transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),and other IBORs, to alternative risk-free rates (RFR)represents a significant challenge to the HAHL Group. Ineffective change and strategic risk management could result in the invalidation of existing contracts as well as ineffective pricing of funds and fair value hedges. Fair value of derivative financial instruments The HAHL Group holds a substantial derivative financial instruments portfolio comprising interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, and index-linked swaps which are accounted for at fair value. In determining the fair value, judgement is used to determine the recovery rate and associated reduction in credit risk of super senior ranking derivatives (interest rate and index-linked swaps). Exceptional items The Group separately presents certain exceptional items on the face of the income statement that impair the visibility of the underlying performance and trends between periods. Exceptional items are material items of income or expense that are considered to merit separate presentation because of their size or nature. They are not expected to be incurred on a recurring basis. Judgement is required in determining whether an item should be classified as an exceptional item or included within underlying results. Audit Committee review and conclusions :IC! Due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, business performance and wider economic uncertainty the Committee reviewed and challenged the impairment assessmentcarried out by management for each cash generating unit ('CGU') identified. The Committee reviewed the assumptions and inputs used to calculate the enterprise value for each CGU and noted there was sufficient headroom when comparing the book value of assets to the valuation derived. In addition to this, the Audit Committee reviewed the assumptions and inputs used to calculate the enterprise value for entity level investments, including the judgement made in relation to the inclusion of a potential RAB adjustment. The Committee noted there was sufficient headroom and reviewed the disclosures made in relation to the judgements applied to the impairment analysis. The Committee challenged and approved the key assumptions with reference to expert third party valuation advice. The review included consideration of the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the key assumptions. The Committee continues to note the sensitivity of the valuation to key assumptions. Further detail of this can be found in note 9. The Committee considered the methodology for the financial and demographic assumptions used in the calculation of the net defined benefit obligation. After receiving expert third party advice, the committee concluded that the assumptions adopted for 2021 were based on reasonable methodology and within an acceptable range. In addition, the Committee reviewed Management's assessment, supported by third party legal advice, that it was appropriate to recognise a scheme surplus in line with the requirements under IFRIC 14 and concluded that there was a reasonable basis to do so. The Committee continues to note the sensitivity of the valuation to key assumptions. Further detail of this can be found in note 18. The Committee sought quarterly updates on management's assessments, including justification of the key assumptions which support the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve and interest rate benchmark reform and transition. The Committee has considered the methods adopted to address the challenges faced by the IBORtransition, including the re-negotiation of existing contracts and the appropriateness of the new risk-free rates adopted. The Committee concluded that the assumptions adopted for 2021 were based on reasonable methodology. In addition, the Committee has reviewed Management's assessment of the overall lBOR impact to the Group and the associated disclosure in these accounts and deemed these to be appropriate. The Committee requested quarterly updates on the estimated fair value of open derivatives and justification of the valuation estimate. The current year fair value position was noted as being particularly volatile due to COVID-19 and global economic uncertainty. The Committee was satisfied that the volatility was being appropriately managed and did not risk the financial stability of the HAHL Group. The Committee continues to support management in its discussion with the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee to clarify whether it is reasonable to designate index-linked swaps as an inflation hedge under IFRS9. Further detail regarding the sensitivity of the year-end valuation to key assumptions can be found in note 16. The Committee reviewed the accounting treatment of exceptional items and agreed that the items listed in note 3 are exceptional in size and nature in relation to the Group and therefore it is appropriate to disclose them separately. The Committee noted that, of the £13 million provision as at 31 December 2020 relating to the businesstransformation programme, £11 million was utilised in the year.
