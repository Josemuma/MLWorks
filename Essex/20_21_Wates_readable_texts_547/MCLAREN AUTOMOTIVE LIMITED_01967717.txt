Highlight [page 13]: Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk - continued The Company has systems and controls in place that manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve its annual plan. The Committee has endorsed a formal process for the collection and mitigation of risks which promotes a consistent risk register across all businesses to assess commonality in risks and trends. McLaren Automotive completed the appropriate review of risks and fed into this process. The output pro.vides reasonable but not an absolute assurance against a risk materialising. The Committee has a stated desire to enhance the risk management framework as the results are collected and consolidated. Once the risks are analysed based on likelihood and impact of occurrence they are debated by senior management and the intention is to deep dive into the key and recurring items. Similarly, data collection will allow presentations to the committee that will focus on the changes to those measures over time. •Once considered by the Committee, the risk register is presented _tothe Group Audit and Risk Committee and the Group Board. Any points raised by the Board will be discussed in tl:iesubsequent Committee meeting.

McLaren operate in the innovation, manufacturing, engineering and motorsports industries which all have historically higher proportions of male employees. Our gender pay gap is driven by the high proportion of men we employ within our business - within our most senior roles - coupled with the relative scarcity of women within our sector's talent pipelines.
