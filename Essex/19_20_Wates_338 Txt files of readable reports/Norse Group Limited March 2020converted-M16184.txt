Corporate govemance 
The Group adopted the Wates principles for corporate governance during the year ending 31 March 2020. 
The Wates principles define six key principles, being; Purpose and Leadership, Board Composition, Director Responsibilities, Opportunity & Risk, Remuneration, and Stakeholder Relationships and Engagement. These principles have been adopted during the year such that the Group's corporate governance structure now operates as follows: Chairperson - oversight of the Board and its meetings, appointed by the ultimate shareholder Norfolk County Council, who also authorise the appointment of any director to the Board of the Group Non-executive directors - appointed to chair advisory committees to the Board and provide an external perspective to the main Group Board Audit Committee - oversight of the internal audit and external audit scope and findings, as well as the Group's risk management systems. Investment Advisory Committee - review of proposed material investments or divestments by the Group. 
Remuneration Committee - review the remuneration policy and related decisions in respect of the directors of the Group.
