Board Governance 
We have updated our approach to reflect changes in the reporting requirements, most notably the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018. 
We have chosen to apply the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies for the year ended 31 March 2020, which have allowed us to reflect on where we have done well, and where we can learn from best practice to raise our corporate governance standards to a higher level. 
The Principles also support directors in meeting the requirements of Section 172 with guidance on the following areas: 
- Purpose and leadership; 
- Board Composition; 
- Director responsibilities; 
- Opportunity and risk; 
- Remuneration; and 
- Stakeholders. 
Our Corporate Governance Statement, which is set out in the statutory accounts for Pinnacle Group Ltd, provides det~ils of how the Group has applied these principles.
