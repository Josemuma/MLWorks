Corporate Governance 
During the period, the Board has welcomed the opportunity to adopt the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies which came into effect this year and so, for the first time, the directors have pleasure in including and presenting a Corporate Governance section for the year ended 31 December 2019 as part of its Annual Report. 
Governance Framework 
Pentland has always endeavoured to apply the highest standards of corporate governance and has a goal of continuous improvement in governance. Until November 1999, Pentland held its own listing on the London Stock Exchange and not only complied with, but supported, the developing requirements of good corporate governance as far back as the Cadbury Committee Report in December 1992. Since once again becoming a private company in 1999, Pentland has continued to implement the evolving good governance practices where it has been practical and appropriate to do so in the context of a family owned business. Today, the largest component of the Group is JD and as a company listed on the London Stock Exchange in its own right, is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council. In accordance with the requirements of the London Stock Exchange Listing Authorities for controlling shareholders, the Company has entered into a Relationship Agreement with the board of JD which protects the independence of the board of JD, allowing them to manage the business without undue influence from the Company as its controlling shareholder. 
The Board has considered the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (the "Regulations"). The Company does not strictly satisfy the criteria to be required to publish a statement of corporate governance arrangements, however, the Board welcomes the focus on governance, purpose and culture and so has decided to include some guidance as to the steps it takes in this important aspect of its operation. 
Statement of Corporate Governance 
We welcome the introduction of the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies which come into effect this year. We echo their sentiments that good business, done well, is a force for good in society. Throughout our 89-year history, we have promoted the principles of strong governance across our business activities, ensuring that they are aligned with a clear purpose. 
Accordingly, the Board has considered the Wates Principles and its application to its corporate governance code, and below we explain how these Wates Principles are reflected in our governance arrangements, with reference to the six key tenets of corporate governance.

Principle 
Principle One: Purpose and Leadership 
An effective board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures :that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. 
Applied How the Company has applied it 
• The Company is a family owned group, with the fourth generation of the family now actively working in the business. 
• We operate primarily in the retail and consumer brands sectors, but also invest outside these core areas to diversify the Group's portfolio where we believe our expertise can create value for ourselves and others. 
• Through the leadership of the Board by the executive chairman, a clear vision for the Group's purpose and overall values is articulated which underpins and defines the strategy and culture of the organisation. Our values are those of the shareholding family, based on social responsibility, inclusion, diversity, longtermism and sustainability. 
• Policies and protocols are in place to support the execution of the Group's purpose and values across the organisation. 
Principle Two: Board Composition 
Effective board composition requires an effective chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, 
experience and 
knowledge, with individual directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The size of a board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company. 
Applied 
• The Board includes six members of the shareholding family and two non-family directors, one of whom is an independent nonexecutive director. 
• The Board operates partly through committees and, in particular, an Investment Committee (chaired by the Board's executive chairman), an Audit and Risk Committee (chaired by our independent non-executive director), a Banking Committee (chaired by our executive non-family member in his executive function as Chief Financial Officer) and a Remuneration Committee. All committees report to the Board at every board meeting and have documented terms of reference, regularly reviewed by the Board. 
• All directors have access to the Company Secretary's office and to the Group's General Counsel for advice and may take professional advice at the Company's expense when required. 
• The biographies of Board members are set out on page 12 and 13. • The Board does not have a formal process for reporting its performance and effectiveness to shareholders, given the wide representation of the shareholders on the Board. However, the need for such evaluation is regularly reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee. 
·- 
• The Company fully supports the professional development of all Board members with each member taking personal responsibility for additional training and support to meet their personal areas of specialism and interest. The Board is actively considering the introduction of a professional development programme for all directors tailored to their individual roles and responsibilities. 
• The Board composition is balanced between executive and nonexecutive directors with a suitably qualified and experienced senior independent non-executive director. 
Principle Three: Responsibilities 
The board and individual directors should have a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The board's policies and procedures should support effective decisionmaking and independent challenge. 
Director Applied 
• The Board is responsible for establishing the culture, values and framework within which the Group operates and is collectively responsible to the Company's stakeholders for the direction and oversight of the Company to ensure its long-term success. It provides leadership, oversees strategy, ensures the necessary resources are available, and sets policies and standards. In doing so, the directors comply with their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 
• Given the purpose of the Company and nature of its ownership, the Board is largely comprised of members of the Rubin family. 
• Given the diverse nature of the businesses within the Group, Board appointments have been made with care and to ensure that its membership includes the right and appropriate levels of skills and experience to address the challenges that the business currently face along with those of the future. 
• Through the Company Secretary's office, the Board has been given sufficient infrastructure to allow them to undertake their work with due care, which is aligned to achieving the Group's long-term success and vision. 
• The Board is focused on improving its operational governance to ensure that the Group's corporate purpose and strategy remains at the centre of its decision-making protocols. 
• The executive roles of individual directors are understood by the Board, although not formally documented. Authority limits are formally agreed by the Board and updated from time to time.


Principle Four: Opportunity and Applied Risk 
A board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, and establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 
• The Board's decisions are focused on promoting and delivering long term value. 
• Principal risks have been identified across the Group and at the operating business level. Risks relating to the retail business of JD are identified and mitigated by their independent board. 
• The Company's Internal Audit function, which reports to the Audit and Risk Committee, operates under a written IA charter agreed by the Board, and is responsible for_ the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's governance, risk management and internal controls, excluding JD whose board makes separate arrangements for reviewing governance, risk management and controls. 
• The Company has implemented a Risk Management Framework to help identify, assess, debate and mitigate the key risks facing us, in order to support the Group's overall purpose. 
Principle Five: Remuneration 
A board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, and establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 
Principle Six: Stakeholder Applied 
Relationships and Engagement Directors should foster 
with effective 
stakeholder relationships aligned to the company's purpose. The board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement 
stakeholders, 
including the workforce, and having regard . to their views when taking decisions. 
Evolving 
• During 2019, the Board formed a Remuneration Committee, with our independent non-executive director as a member. The role of the committee is to set the remuneration and incentives for executive Board members and senior executives to ensure that reward decisions are aligned with our business strategy, culture and values, whilst supporting an effective and efficient talent management strategy. 
• The Company benefits from having all key shareholders being members of its board of directors which reduces the agency risk involved in managing the business. 
• The Company expects its operating businesses to maintain a high level of direct engagement with their key stakeholders, whether their employees, suppliers, customers, tax authorities, regulators or other governmental bodies, pensioners or community groups. 
• The Board engages regularly with its own stakeholders, including its shareholders, lending institutions, direct employees, pensioners, regulators, tax authorities, Government authorities and their agencies, professional advisors, underlying investment businesses, communities, and individual directors. How the Board has engaged with key stakeholders during the course of the year can be found on pages 3 to 6.
