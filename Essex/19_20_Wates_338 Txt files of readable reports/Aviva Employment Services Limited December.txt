The Board monitors the culture of the Company and raises any concerns during meetings. Culture information has been added to the Board's annual planner to ensure the Board has the opportunity to review culture metrics and that employees have the right values, attitudes and behaviours and are focussed on doing the right thing for the customer. The Company complies with the Senior Managers' Certification Regime which further strengthens the drive for individual accountability. Employee engagement is sought through the Voice of Aviva employee surveys, the output of which is reviewed by the Board and an action plan put in place to address areas identified by employees which may require further focus.
