Corporate governance statement 
The Board presents its Corporate Governance Statement for the period to 1 February 2020. This statement includes a review of how corporate governance acts as the foundation to our business and the decisions taken by the Company and across the Group. 
During the reporting period the Company, and its key operating subsidiaries and affiliated companies, adopted the Wates Principles and undertook an internal governance review. Having adopted the Wates Principles, the Company reviewed its internal governance to better align its governance with the guidelines enumerated by the Wates Principles. This included ensuring that there is an appropriate number of board meetings, with appropriate terms of reference in place, that attendees' roles and responsibilities are periodically reviewed and that appropriate processes are in place for key decisions to be made. The details regarding Company board meetings in 2019 are set out on page 4. 
The Group takes very seriously the importance of good governance and, whilst being a private, family-owned business, one of the core principles of the Group's strategy is that we are transparent, both in how we communicate with each other within the Group and externally, with the outside world. The Company is in the process of updating its corporate governance framework across the Group. As detailed in 'The Directors and their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006' (the "Section 172 Statement") in the Strategic Report, the framework will support the directors in ensuring compliance with both the Wates Principles and their fiduciary duties, with a view to ensuring that the Company's directors and subsidiaries' directors can demonstrate sound and competent execution of their statutory duties. 
The Board continues to delegate key matters and stakeholder engagement to its subsidiaries. Principal decisions made during the reporting period have been referred to above and in the Section 172 Statement. The subsidiaries report back to the Board and/or Executive Management of the Company via various committees and periodic meetings, as part of wider risk management and internal controls in place across the Group, allowing the Board to demonstrate its oversight of any delegated responsibilities. 
The Board is ultimately responsible for organising and directing the affairs of the Company in a manner most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its sole shareholder, whilst complying with legal and regulatory frameworks. Directors are required to consider factors which will contribute to the Company's success, and those that are affected by the Company's activities (details of the principal risks and uncertainties are set out on page 3 - Strategic Report). 
The Six Wates Principles and how these are applied: 
1. Purpose and Leadership 
• The Company is a holding company whose main role is oversight of its subsidiaries, being iconic retail brands including Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland, Selfridges in the UK and de Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. These iconic retail brands provide leading retail experiences for customers worldwide through its store network and online platforms. 
• The Company's activities consist of providing various corporate functions to its operating subsidiaries, including finance and treasury, tax, legal, property, strategy, audit and risk management, and human resources services. 
• The Group continues to oversee strategy. The Board and Executive Management are committed to the Group strategy and to the creation of long-term sustainable value, for the benefit of its sole shareholder and wider stakeholders. 
• The Board and Executive Management ensure that that the Group operates its business in line with the Group strategy. 
2. Board Composition 
• The Board, Executive Management and each of the Committees across the Group consist of individuals who are appointed to their roles with consideration of skills, experience, capability and their ability to lead the business with effective and strategic decision making. Board meetings are held at least once a year and more often as required. In addition to approving any strategic and other key decisions, board meetings are held to approve the payment of dMdends, to appoint and remove directors, to approve the financial statements, as well as to approve other corporate reporting, such as the Group's tax strategy and modern slavery statement. 
• Other business may be addressed as required at board meetings or through written resolutions.
3. Director  Responsibilities 
• All new directors and new members of the Executive Management team are provided with an orientation and training programme covering their duties and responsibilities. General training is provided to all directors and officers at least annually. 
• The directors and Executive Management also have opportunities to participate in training when there are key changes in legislation and guidance. This enables the directors and Executive Management to continue to be aware of the environment in which they make decisions and ensure that their decision-making is underpinned by good governance. All Board members and Executive Management have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
• The directors and Executive Management are aware of their duties should conflicts of interest arise. A formal request asking directors to disclose any conflict or potential conflict is sent out and collated once a year. The articles of association of the Company contain conflict provisions to ensure that the directors do not breach their duties. These provisions also support the directors in their duty to exercise independent judgement. 
• The Company engages independent external advice on key matters as required. • The Board, delegated to Executive Management as appropriate, reviews the public reports required to be published by the Company and its subsidiaries each year, including financial statements, gender pay gap report, modem slavery statement and tax strategy reports. 
• The Board is committed to reviewing and, where appropriate, improving its operational governance and ensuring that the Company's strategy, as well as the proper discharge of directors' duties, are fully considered and demonstrably remain central to all Company decisions. 
• The Group Risk Management Committee {RMC) meets bi-annually, and more regularly as necessary. The AMC operates under its Terms of Reference which cover its role, remit, quorum and purpose of meetings. The RMC supports the Board in identifying and managing key corporate risks, identifying actions for directors and managers to address or mitigate risks or to improve controls. The AMC meetings are chaired by the Group Finance Director. 
• The Board and the AMC are supported by Executive Management and other senior team members from across the Company. The subsidiaries each have their own risk committees, which feed into the AMC. The AMC provides a bi-annual report and update to the Company's parent company. 
• An Audit Committee is in place in respect of each of the operating subsidiaries. At least one representative of the Board sits on each Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meetings take place bi-annually and are also attended by representatives from Group Audit and Risk and Group Legal. 
• The Company sets the agenda for the subsidiaries' Audit Committees to ensure the Audit Committees cover all key areas required for appropriate oversight of subsidiaries. The Board discusses and approves the key topics and themes arising from previous Audit Committees. There are also audit and governance committees of the parent company that are attended by certain of the Company's directors and representatives of Executive Management and senior team members as required. This provides a robust review of all subsidiaries and ensures that the directors of the Company and its sole shareholder have oversight and an understanding of the principal risks and opportunities (as further detailed below) within the subsidiaries' businesses and are able to satisfy their duties as directors of the Comoanv.
4. Opportunity and Risk 
• The Board and the RMC are committed to regularly reviewing the Company's and its subsidiaries' principal risks and opportunities to ensure that these are adequately addressed. This is with a view to ensuring the Company is promoting and delivering long term value to the shareholder, in line with the Group's strategy. 
• Principal risks have been identified across the Company at a department, project and subsidiary level. Risks are assessed on a matrix of impact (financial and reputational) and likelihood, with target risks noted and a plan to address, mitigate or improve the risk position where possible. This is supported by input from the Audit and Risk Management Committees. 
• The key corporate risks are as identified on page 3. 
•  All risks have mitigation plans in place. 
• The directors regularly discuss and receive updates on key risk matters and ensure these are factored into decisions made, with appropriate controls in place such as policies, formal contracts with third parties and insurance coverage, each where appropriate. 
• Significant capital expenditure projects are reviewed by senior individuals as part of a capital approval process. The risks of each significant transaction are reviewed against internal mechanisms and monitored on ongoing basis 
5. Remuneration 
• The Group has a Remuneration Committee which reviews the compensation for defined senior team members of the Company and across the Group at least once per year. This is governed by the Remuneration Committee's Terms of Reference which outline the Remuneration Committee's remit and responsibilities. 
• The Remuneration Committee ensures there are clear pay structures based on grade, seniority and responsibility. Bonus schemes are aligned with the Company's financial and operating performance and individual performance, as well as behaviours in line with the Group's strategy. 
• The Remuneration Committee meetings are always attended by a representative of the shareholder to support engagement. 
6. Stakeholder Relationships and Engagement 
• The Board regularly engages with its sole shareholder and ensures the shareholder is kept abreast of developments both at Company and subsidiary level. This includes Audit Committee meetings as referred to above, budget meetings and quarterly business reviews, in respect of each subsidiary's business. 
• The Group HR function oversees an annual employee engagement survey across the Group, with surveys carried out during the year as required. The surveys are completed by team members across the Group. There is a robust process in place for analysis of the results and feedback is taken into account by the Board and Executive Management in decision making. 
• As detailed in the Stakeholder Engagement Statement, the Board has delegated day-to-day engagement with key stakeholders across the Group to the respective subsidiaries and ensures oversight via regular engagement with the respective subsidiaries.
