Lothian Buses Limited December 2019_conv
Corporate Governance Report 
For the year ended 31 December 2019 Basis of Principles Applied 
For the year ended 31 December 2019, under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/860), the Company has applied these regulations in full and has followed the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies (published by the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') in December 2018 and available on the FRC website). 
The new corporate governance reporting requirements apply for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2019 and Companies are able to adopt the Wates principles as an appropriate framework when making disclosures regarding corporate governance arrangements. The Principles applied are set out below. 
Principle 1 - Purpose and Leadership 
Lothian was founded in 1919 and is now in its 101 st year. Lothian Buses Limited is owned by the four Lothian local authorities which resulted in the dissolution of the former Lothian Regional Council at the .time of the Local Government reorganisation in 1994. The Lothian Group is the principal operator of bus services within the City of Edinburgh, Midlothian and East Lothian Council areas. We also operate bus services in West Lothian and operate open top sightseeing tours in Edinburgh and the City Region, in addition to day tours by coach, private hire and excursions. 
Our vision is to be: 
• The most customer led; • Focussed and innovative public transport operator in Scotland; • Delivering safe, compliant and reliable bus services. 
The Group's purpose, goals and targets were revised during 2019 in the Business Plan for 2020-24, under the Board's direction, to guide the organisation's strategy, decisions, processes and culture. The Business Plan will be communicated to senior managers throughout 2020. It builds on the Group's existing commitment to good governance and social responsibility. 
The Directors and Shareholding Councils see themselves as actively engaged stewards of a socially responsible network of Bus Services. The Directors and the Board maintain a visible presence in the Group, promoting a long-term ethos, inclusion, diversity, community engagement, social responsibility and environmental sustainability. 
Principle 2 - Board Composition Details of each Board Director can be found on page 2. 
The Group has a separate Chairman and Managing Director to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making across the Group are effectively maintained. The Chairman plays a pivotal role in creating the conditions for overall Board and individual Director effectiveness. 
The Board comprises a Chairman, three Executive Directors, an Independent Non-Executive Director, five NonExecutive Directors (which includes one Worker Director) and an Observer from each of our Shareholding Councils and immediate parent, Transport for Edinburgh Limited. This size and composition is appropriate to our large and complex business. Independent Non-Executive Directors bring experience in transport, systems, procurement, politics, governance, finance and audit, in addition to perspectives and challenge from outside the sector and environment in which the Group operates. 
We consider there to be sufficient experience and diversity on the Board and recognise that this is not always easy to maintain within the industry as a whole. We are committed to making the Group an ever-more inclusive environment, thereby fostering a more diverse workforce which should increase diversity at the most senior levels. We demonstrated our commitment to this area by publishing our Diversity & Inclusion Policy in 2019.


Principle 2 - Board Composition (continued) 
The Directors have equal voting rights when making decisions, except the Chairman, who has the casting vote. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may, if they wish, take professional advice at the company's expense. 
The duties of the Board are executed partially through committees. The Non-Executive Directors attend and act as chair to relevant committees so that they are able to challenge and influence a broad range of areas across the Group. 
The Executive Team ensures that the values, strategy and culture align, are implemented and are communicated consistently to the workforce - for example through regular Senior Leadership Team meetings and away days that are attended by senior employees. 
Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group by meeting with senior management, visiting sites (such as regular visits to our garages) and by attending appropriate external seminars and training courses. There is an induction programme for all new Directors which is tailored to their specific experience and knowledge and which provides access to all parts of the business, including access to shareholders. 
There is an annual Board Effectiveness Review around February of each year and it is attended by all the Independent Non-Executive Directors to maintain impartiality and good governance. The 2019 Board Effectiveness Review held on 28 February 2019 assessed that the Board was competent and well run and had the potential to become even more effective by clearly aligning its agenda to strategic development, encouraging all Directors to share their thoughts, observations and instincts for the benefit of all, and engaging the whole Board more routinely in the active management of shareholder relations. 
Since the last Board Effectiveness Review there has been a significant emphasis on strategic issues being considered on a regular basis, with operational matters and performance monitoring spread over the course of the annual Board programme. 
The Executive Team occasionally uses externally facilitated sessions to assist in progressing actions and plans agreed for delivery. The Board considers these externally facilitated sessions important in the delivery of key areas and for strengthening overall output and performance. 
Principle 3 - Directors Responsibilities Accountability 
Good governance supports open and fair business, ensures that the company has the right safeguards in place and makes certain that every decision it takes is underpinned by the right considerations. Whilst Board oversight is always maintained, key decisions are made by the individuals and committees with the most appropriate knowledge and industry experience. Each Board member has a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The Board has a programme of five principal meetings a year together with the Annual General Meeting after the June meeting each year. The Board's key areas of focus in 2019 are included on pages 13 and 14. 
The Board members act in accordance with best practice behaviours and values. As part of each Board meeting all members must declare any potential conflicts of interest. These declarations are collated by the Chairman and communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee, if necessary. Where there are potential conflicts, appropriate safeguards are implemented.


Committees 
The Board delegates authority for the day-to-day management of the company to the Executive Team who meet weekly and is chaired by the Managing Director and whose membership includes the Operations Director, Commercial Director, Engineering Director, Finance Director and Communications Director. Leaders of each Business function (for example, Commercial, Human Resources, Health & Safety, etc) are invited to meetings as and when required. 
The Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no material business or relationships with the company that might influence their independence or judgement. In addition, certain governance responsibilities are delegated to other committees (Audit & Risk, Remuneration, Nomination or the Regional Sub Committee). These committees include both Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, who support effective decision making and independent challenge. 
Integrity of information 
The Board receives regular and timely information (at least quarterly) on all key aspects of the business including health and safety, risks and opportunities, the financial performance of the Group, strategy, operational matters, market conditions and sustainability, all supported by a summary from the Managing Director. 
Key financial information is collated from the Group's various accounting systems. The Group's finance function is appropriately qualified and ensures the integrity and accurate timely production of this information. The finance function is also provided with the necessary training to keep up to date with regulatory changes. Financial information is currently externally audited by Scott-Moncrieff on an annual basis and financial controls are reviewed and maintained by the Group's finance function. 
Other key information is prepared by the relevant internal function. Processes for collecting data, as well as the reporting of that data, is reviewed on a regular basis by the finance function with reporting thereon provided to the Audit & Risk Committee. 
Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk The Board seeks out opportunity whilst mitigating risk. Opportunity 
Long term strategic opportunities are highlighted in the business planning process which is completed every 3 to 5 years. The Board seeks out opportunities drawn from the business plan, strategy and the committees to which it delegates. Short term opportunities to improve performance, resilience and liquidity are collated through the quarterly garage review process which is attended by the Executive Team. Short term strategic opportunities are highlighted in the annual Group budget process which is presented to the Board at the end of every year. 
Risk 
The Audit & Risk Committee, consisting of certain Executive Directors and certain Non-Executive Directors, ensures that inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed appropriately in a timely manner. Its focus is on monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's approach to risk identification, classification and mitigation. The Committee meets five or six times a year and reviews the risk register for any changes in underlying conditions. The Committee continues to refine and enhance the company's risk management framework and the content of the risk register and works to ensure consistency across all operations. A list of emerging risks is maintained by the Audit & Risk Committee and considered at each meeting - an emerging risk is included on the risk register once its likelihood and impact of occurrence becomes material to the Group. 
The company's Strategic Report includes the key operational risks and uncertainties that are monitored by the Audit & Risk Committee. The risk register is presented to the Board at each meeting. Specific points raised by the Board are discussed in the subsequent Audit & Risk Committee and vice versa. The company's systems and controls are designed to manage, rather than to entirely eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not an absolute assurance against a risk materialising.


Responsibilities 
The Group has an operating framework which encapsulates the Group's operating rules, processes, best practice standards and delegated authorities. It is the fundamental platform to our internal control and governance framework. 
Specifically, the Board approves any contract above a certain value (determined by the Board) or any transaction that requires an unbudgeted allocation of capital, to ensure that the appropriate level of diligence has been performed in understanding the obligations, risks and terms of the contract. This enables the Group to protect the integrity and long-term sustainability of all its businesses, to meet its strategic objectives and to create value for its shareholders, customers and suppliers. 
Principle 5 - Remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee's primary objective is to set remuneration at a level that will enhance the Group's resources by securing and retaining quality senior management who can deliver the Group's strategic ambitions in a manner consistent with both its purpose and the interests of its shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee has clearly defined terms of reference and is responsible for making recommendations to the Board concerning the Group's remuneration strategy, recruitment framework and longterm plans for senior executives. In doing so, the Committee takes advice from independent external consultants who provide updates on legislative requirements, best market practice and remuneration benchmarking, drawing on evidence from across the sectors in which the Group operates and from other comparable sectors. Pay is aligned with responsibilities and performance and takes in to account fair pay and conditions across the Group's workforce. 
An independent review was last performed in 2018, which highlighted that the Group's remuneration policy for Directors and Senior Management is consistent with companies of a similar size and complexity, as well as other companies operating within comparable sectors. The next review is scheduled for March 2020. Directors' remuneration is disclosed on page 56 (note 25). 
In 2019, the Group reported its Gender Pay Reporting which highlighted some specific areas of focus for 2019 and beyond. The Group is an active equal opportunities employer and promotes an environment free from discrimination, harassment and victimisation, where everyone receives equal treatment and career development regardless of age, gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation or disability. All decisions relating to employment practices (including remuneration) are objective, free from bias and based solely upon work criteria and individual merit. 
Principle 6 - Stakeholders 
The Board is clear that good governance and effective communication are essential on a day-to-day basis to deliver our purpose and to protect the Group's brand, reputation and relationships with all of our stakeholder community including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities in which we work and serve. 
The Board continues to seek to align the Group's strategic direction with its purpose and to the shareholders' long-term aspirations for sustainability, growth, diversification, environmental targets and policy decisions. The Chairman and Managing Director of the Board are the primary communication routes between the Board and the Company's shareholders. Together with the Commercial Director they work to ensure common goals amongst the wider shareholder group. 
External impacts 
The Board is committed to social responsibility, community engagement and environmental sustainability. It achieves this in part through its commitment to: a positive work culture (ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of everyone who works in the Group); creating positive environmental and social impact; being an employer of choice where everyone is valued and respected; and seeking new ways to ensure the sustainability of the buildings we operate and maintain.


Stakeholders 
The Board promotes accountability and transparency with all external stakeholders and with representatives of government and other opinion leaders, whilst maintaining an open and balanced presence in the media. The Group's fundamental belief in promoting the public good is demonstrated and supported by the Chairman and Managing Director's active engagement across industry bodies and our wider stakeholder community. 
Every year the Group hosts local Doors Open Day's which are community events where the public get to come along to one of our garages and see a selection of our buses, both old and new, and enjoy a great day out. 
The Group uses customer engagement surveys where the findings are used to improve customer engagement with knowledge being shared across all of our companies and divisions. 
In 2019 the Group obtained Earned Recognition Status which was an external audit and validation mainly of the Group's ability to perform its vehicle MOT testing to DVSA standards. 
The Annual General Meeting held in June each year provides a briefing on the Group's financial performance and allows individuals to raise any questions or concerns. 
The Executive Team meets regularly with Union representatives of the Group to facilitate communication of current issues and the Group's plans and purpose. During 2019 a new Recognition and Procedural Agreement was completed. The Board considers positive Union engagement a good barometer of the workforce's confidence in the Group's strategic direction, optimism in the future, working conditions and career opportunities. The Executive Team has taken part in a number of initiatives over the past year to further improve employee relations by engaging further at both Group and divisional level, improving communication, expanding flexible benefits on offer, encouraging more flexible working practices and wellbeing initiatives where possible and updating the Group's intranet and internal TV screens as channels of communication to share information, best practice, achievements and success. 
The Group provides both Gender Pay Reporting and Payment Practices & Performance Reporting, both of which are published externally. The Group maintains the additional analysis required to conduct this reporting and welcomes these routes of reporting as it is constantly looking to improve its engagement with stakeholders. 
The Group communicates regularly with the Lothian Pension Fund, which operates the Company's defined benefit pension scheme, and Scottish Widows, which operates the Company's defined contribution schemes, both of which are wholly independent of the Company. These regular communications are key to ensuring that the decisions made by both the Company and the scheme reflect the interest of all stakeholders. 
The company's website (www.lothianbuses.co.uk), intranet, Lothian TV screens and social media channels provide extensive and up-to-date news on recent developments.

Audit & Risk Committee 
The Committee's primary concerns are the integrity of the Group's financial statements; the effectiveness of internal controls; the adequacy of internal audit reviews; the performance and independence of the external auditor and the Group's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
The Committee has clearly defined terms of reference, which are reviewed annually and are available from the Committee Chair. These outline the Committee's objectives and responsibilities relating to financial reporting, internal controls, risk management and the application of appropriate accounting standards and procedures. Specific responsibilities include reviewing and recommending for approval the annual financial statements, reviewing the Group's accounting policies, reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls, risk management processes and reviewing the scope and results of the external audit. The Committee monitors existing compliance arrangements and the overall requirement for additional internal audit reviews. 
lain Reid, a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, was appointed Committee Chair in September 2019, after taking over from Anthony Rose. The Audit Committee comprises of two other independent Non-Executive Directors; Anthony Rose and Susan Deacon together with the Board Chairman, Jim McFarlane. The Board is satisfied that the recent and relevant financial and risk experience of the Committee Chair and the Committee's members during 2019 followed the principles of good governance in relation to their skills, knowledge and experience. 
External Auditors 
Scott-Moncrieff Audit Services were re-appointed external auditors at the Group's Annual General Meeting in June 2019. The Committee assesses the effectiveness of their performance every year after completion of the annual audit and in April 2019 the Committee evaluated their performance in relation to the 2018 audit. The evaluation takes the form of speaking to the staff involved in the audit process, including members of the financial, commercial, IT and payroll functions and also members of the Executive Team. The calibre of the external auditors, their governance, independence and professionalism continues to receive good feedback. Both management and external auditors are committed to a positive working relationship that enhances the effective and efficient execution of the audit process. As a private company, the Group is not subject to external restrictions in terms of non-audit work provided by the external auditors, but for good governance has chosen to implement its own policy in relation to the level of their remuneration and the extent of their non-audit services. 
At its meeting in April 2019 the Audit & Risk Committee was satisfied that the Group's external auditors' engagement policy had been complied with and concluded that the external auditors remained objective and independent and that the audit process was effective and robust. Scott-Moncrieff Audit Services were last reappointed external auditors in a tender process in June 2017. The Audit Committee identifies re-tendering of the external audit service around every three years as good practice. 


Remuneration Committee 
The Committee's primary objective is to set remuneration at a level that will enhance the Group's resources by attracting, retaining and motivating quality senior management who can deliver the Group's strategic ambitions within a framework that is aligned with shareholder interests. 
The Committee firmly believes that the best people on the right remuneration, with an emphasis on performance, strengthens the Group's ability to face challenges emanating from economic and market change, and to deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. 
In 2019, the Committee comprised three Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by Mark Yexley and the other members are Steven Cassidy and lain Reid. Ewan Kennedy also attends as observer from the City of Edinburgh Council. In 2019 there were 3 meetings. 
Nominations Committee 
The Board operates a Nominations Committee to ensure that the Board remains balanced and effective, that succession plans are in place, and that its structure, composition and skills remain aligned to the Group's strategic objectives. The Committee's primary objective, when necessary, is to identify and evaluate candidates for future appointments and, in doing so, it takes advice from independent external recruitment consultants. In 2019, the Committee comprised four Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by James McFarlane and the other members are Susan Deacon, Steven Cassidy and Mark Yexley. Ewan Kennedy also attends as observer from the City of Edinburgh Council. The Committee has no formal schedule of meetings and meets as required. There were no meetings held in 2019. 
Regional Sub Committee 
The Regional Sub Committee is a Committee of the Board, comprising a number of Directors and at least one representative appointed by each Minority Shareholder. The Chairman of the Committee shall be appointed by the Board, and is currently Susan Deacon. There shall be at least 2 meetings per year and in 2019 there was 2 meetings. The Committee shall review and consider the integration of the bus networks in Edinburgh and the Lothians as part of an integrated network of public transport. 
Executive Team 
The Executive Team is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group's business affairs under leadership of the Managing Director. The Team's duties include formulating strategy proposals for Board approval and ensuring that the agreed strategy is implemented in a timely and effective manner. 
The Executive Team consists of individuals responsible for the key business units and functions. The Team includes the Managing Director, Commercial Director, Operations Director, Engineering Director, Finance Director, Communications Director and HR's Head of People. 
Risk Register 
The Group operates a Risk Register to ensure that inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed in a timely manner and at an appropriate level. The Audit & Risk Committee and the Board review the Risk Register which is updated by the Executive Team for each meeting. The Committee and Board respond to specific areas of risk and approve and promote standards and best practice processes where control weaknesses are considered to exist. The Risk Register allows the Group's approach to risk management and mitigation to be focused on the key risks affecting the main financial and operational performance issues.
