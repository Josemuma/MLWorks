STATEMENT OF CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS 
In accordance with the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulation 2018, the Board has reviewed its corporate governance arrangements and the statement below explains how the Group has applied the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Wates Corporate Governance Principles. 
Gatwick's Purpose & Leadership: 
As set out in detail within sections 1-4 of the Strategic Report, the Board has set out the ambition of the Group "to compete to grow and become London's airport of choice" in a way that benefits all - our passengers, our people, our business partners and our communities. 
The Board has established six strategic priorities to: deliver the best passenger experience; help our airlines grow; increase value and efficiency; protect and enhance its reputation; build a strong environment, health and safety culture; and develop the best people, processes and technology. The Board implements this strategy by aligning all its activities with these priorities. 
Balancing Opportunity and Risk to create long-term sustainable success: As set out in detail within section 2 of the Strategic Report, the Board is committed to promoting the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value and establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 
Set out below is a summary of three key on-going areas of focus for the Board: 
1. Extension of the Commitments Regulatory Framework • Since 1 April 2014, Gatwick's regulatory framework is based on Commitments backed by a licence and supplemented by a monitoring regime. The Commitments are a set of legally enforceable undertakings, made by Gatwick to airlines, covering price, service, transparency, financial resilience, operational resilience and dispute resolution. The Commitments also enable Gatwick to enter into a series of bilateral contracts incorporating, for example, price, service and duration, agreed on a contractual basis between Gatwick and individual airlines. 
• Given that Gatwick has maintained a strong operational performance over recent years, in June 2018 the CAA published CAP 1684: "Future economic regulation of Gatwick Airport Limited: initial consultation" which is broadly supportive of Gatwick's favoured process of approaching the airlines directly with a commercial proposal, recognising this mechanism was embedded in the original Commitments, beyond the expiry of the current Commitments framework on 31 March 2021.


Delivering Sustainable Growth by Engaging and Delivering for our Stakeholders • The key strategic objective for Gatwick is to compete to grow and become London's airport of choice. A key enabler in delivering this objective is continued focus on transforming the passenger and airline airport experience through both investment in modern infrastructure and improving service standards. Significant further investment is planned to expand current facilities where required, to achieve greater operational efficiency and improve the passenger experience for all segments of the passenger journey. 
• Gatwick is operating close to its permitted limit on annual aircraft movements and is the busiest single runway airport in the world. As a result, management has identified that sustainable growth and increased airport capacity could be delivered through further development of our existing infrastructure. 
• Gatwick continues to build and maintain strong relationships with stakeholders including the Government, airlines, business partners, passengers and employees. Working closely with these stakeholders ensures that the Airport can influence and shape future policy and decisions that may affect Gatwick and the aviation industry, and also to identify joint working opportunities to promote best practice. 
• Gatwick understands the importance to its business of the communities in which it operates, and through consultation and engagement seeks to ensure that their concerns are taken into account in the operation and planning of Gatwick. The Board is committed to managing the airport responsibly, such that economic benefits are optimised without prioritising profits over the long term interests of local communities. 
• Gatwick continues to work collaboratively with its partners to deliver sustainable growth. ltis on track to meet the 2020 Decade of Change objectives, which has set a strong foundation for the next decade. Gatwick has made significant progress on all areas of focus, it continues to reduce the Airport's environmental impact, by delivering sustainable growth. 
• Gatwick has maintained its environmental permits and licenses and have had no formal reportable environmental incidents 
• The Group undertakes procurement responsibly and encourages trade and employment opportunities for local communities. Gatwick has a transparent recruitment process and is committed to recruiting diverse talented individuals from all sectors of the community. Gatwick has developed a number of strategies and policies to engage, motivate and challenge its employees as well as rewarding appropriately. 
• Gatwick has a range of formal consultative bodies that discuss pay, conditions of employment, and business issues with three recognised trade unions (Unite, Prospect, and PCS). The Gatwick Joint Committee, the top-level consultative forum in the Airport, provides a forum for the workforce to share with management their views on business strategy and performance. 
3. Maintaining an effective risk management culture and internal control environment • As set out in detail within section 5 of the Strategic Report, an effective risk management culture and internal control environment is a central element of the Group's strategic decisions and operations. The Group is committed to implementing appropriate strategies and processes that identify, analyse and manage the risks associated with the organisation in order to minimise the frequency and impact of undesired and unexpected events on the Group's objectives, while enabling it to optimise its business opportunities. 
• 
Whilst these internal controls and processes are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatements or loss, the Audit Committee provides the Board, amongst other things, with independent oversight of the risk management of the Group. 
• The principal corporate risks as identified by the Board are detailed within Section 5 of the strategic report.


Board Composition, Responsibilities & Remuneration: 
• The Corporate Governance and Leadership of the Group is set out in detail within section 4 of the Strategic Report. 
• 
This provides a detailed description of the Board of Directors (the 'Board') and Committees of the Board. Each board comprises a chair, a number of non-executive directors and advisers which together bring a broad balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge. 
• Each Board and Committees of the Board have a formal terms of reference which set out clearly their accountability and responsibilities. The Board's policies and procedures support effective decisionmaking and independent challenge. 
• The Renumeration Committee ensures that executive remuneration structures align to the long-term sustainable success of a company, taking into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the company.
