The principal focus of the Company during 2019 continued to be that of an employing company. The Board received updates, and monitored matters relating to the Group's people strategy and culture, employee benefits and the ongoing benefits harmonisation work following the transaction. This included updates on the TUPE transfer process and the efforts to align the pension schemes, as well as reviewing updates on the London office relocation to the St. Botolph building. In addition, the Board retained a focus on a number of other matters which included the 2018 year end review process and the total compensation review, attrition rates, gender pay gap reporting, the Modern Slavery Statement, global mobility, changes in HR legislation and relevant internal policies, diversity and inclusion, the graduate and apprenticeship schemes and UK payment practices. The Board has discussed the feedback and actions arising from engagement surveys and the developing culture of the Group remains an important consideration. 
The Board has also received updates from a management committee considering health and safety matters and received copies of the minutes of the meetings of an Employee Consultative Forum, the Colleague Information and Consultation Forum (CICC).

Principle 6 - Stakeholder Relationships and Engagement (continued) Employees (continued) 
Throughout 2019, and during preceding years, the Marsh group has had in place an Employee Consultative Forum (the Colleague Information and Consultation Committee (CICC) which represented employees from all offices and lines of business in discussions of a more formal nature with executive management. This has been instrumental in supporting colleagues through contractual and structural changes and acting as a sounding board for the Marsh Executive Team. Additionally in 2019, the CICC assisted with the appropriate consultation with employees who joined the Company through the acquisition of JL T. A separate committee made up of elected members of the JLT population was used to consult with employees, specifically on the TUPE Transfer. Early in 2020, the CICC was expanded to include members of legacy JL T population. The CICC comprises of elected representatives from across all offices and lines of business and includes legacy JL T employees. The Chairman of the CICC is elected from the employee representatives. The CICC meets regularly and is engaged to, for example, provide feedback to executive management on policy amendments, proposals for changes to benefits and to support colleagues when structure changes are proposed. 
Representatives of the various employee forums are now invited to attend a meeting of the Board to update the Directors on activities and any areas of concern. In addition, summaries of the MSL Board meetings are being shared with the Boards of its sister companies, Marsh Ltd and GC. 
In 2019, work to develop a definition of the culture for the Group was a key priority for the Board, the Marsh Ltd and GC Boards and the Executive teams. A programme has been developed with an external provider called MindGym. This comprises three elements, an all colleague survey to establish a base point for our current culture, the creation of a narrative statement to define the desired culture and a development/monitoring plan to achieve this. 
The Group and Company is committed to reinforcing a wholly inclusive culture across a truly diverse workforce. The Diversity and Inclusion goals and plan was presented to the Marsh Ltd Board in 2019, when Marsh Ltd signed up to the Women in Finance Charter. This included a commitment to achieve 25% of women being in our most senior roles by the end of 2023. Activity and progress toward this goal is regularly reported to the MSL and Marsh Boards. It is intended that the other businesses will look to make this commitment also going forward. 
It is the Group and the Company's policy to give full consideration to suitable applications for employment from disabled persons. Every effort is made, where employees of the Company become disabled, to retain them in their existing employment. 
The Company and Group are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace and working environment for employees, contractors and visitors by providing adequate welfare facilities and maintaining suitable plant and safe systems of work. A further statement on Health, Safety and Environment is set out below on page 12 of the Strategic Report. 
The Company participates in two UK pension schemes. Both schemes are governed by an independent Trustee Board and another Group Company, Marsh & McLennan Companies UK Limited (MMCUKL), is the principal employer for both schemes. The Trustee Board is made up of both MMCUKL appointed and member nominated Trustee Directors. The Trustee Board is responsible for communicating and engaging with pension scheme members and does this on a regular basis, including through an annual newsletter. Members can also ask questions and provide feedback via the administration teams who support the pension schemes. MMCUKL engages with the Trustee Board as part of the Trustee Board's quarterly meeting schedule and through a Joint Working Group which is made up of representatives of both the MMCUKL and Trustee Boards.

Given the Group's expertise in risk, strategy and people, our social impact efforts are focused on 'building resilient communities through mentoring and disaster response and rebuilding.'

The Group partners with select strategic global non-profit organisations, including; the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, Junior Achievement, Missing Maps and the British Red Cross in the UK and encourages colleagues to volunteer with its non-profit partners, for local causes that are important to them and their clients. 
Suppliers 
The Group monitors its relationship with its suppliers on a regular basis. Representatives of key suppliers are being invited to attend a Board meeting of the Company's sister Company, Marsh Corporate Services Ltd (MCSL) to update the MCSL Directors on activities and discuss any areas of concern. In addition, summaries of the MCSL Board meeting are being shared with the Marsh Ltd and GC Ltd Boards to aid communication.
