Governance Framework 
The Group endeavours to follow high standards of corporate governance, with the board of directors and Group 
management detennining the governance framework for the whole of the Group, including for the Company. All references to The Board relate to the Board of Eagle Topco Limited, being the Company at which Group decisions are considered and the overall strategy is detennined. The Board has considered the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (the Regulations) for the accounting year beginning on 1 January 2019, including the requirement to state which corporate code it has applied. 
Noting the above, the corporate governance statement in this section is extracted from the financial statements for Eagle Topco Limited, with the governance framework adopted by the Board applying to the whole Group, including the Company. For the year ended 31 December 2019, under the Regulations, the Group has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies (published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in December 2018 and available on the FRC website) {the Wates Principles). The Wates Principles provide a framework for the Group to not only demonstrate how the Board makes decisions for the long tenn success of the Group and its stakeholders (see Stakeholder Engagement, on page 12), but also have regard to how the Board ensures the Group complies with the requirements of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2016. Our reporting against the Wates Principles has been included on pages 7 to 16.
The Board - Purpose, vision and leadership The Board determines the long-term strategy, direction and performance of the Group. The Group's Vision is to give every child the best start in life and the Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group's strategy and culture is aligned with this. 
The Group's Mission is to "deliver high quality childcare and exciting opportunities for learning that give every child a head start as they prepare for school", supported by its core Values of"Care, Service, Quality and Value". The Group's Vision, Mission and Core Values were established, under the Board's direction, to underpin the Group's strategy, decisions and culture. These are codified in the Group's Code of Conduct, and form the basis of all other Group policies, all of which are distributed to staff annually as part of their training programmes and are included as part of any new staff induction process. The Group's Code of Conduct makes clear that the Group is expected to operate to the highest standards in everything it does, setting out expectations for staff and requiring them to always operate fairly and ethically in all areas of the business to maintain the Group's reputation and status. This policy, and all other Group policies, is supported by the Speak Up policy, which sets out the action staff are expected to take if they have a concern about something they see or hear that is in breach of the Group's policies. This policy is further supported by the Group's Speak Up line, which allows staff to raise concerns through a dedicated helpline. The Group's strategy was shared with the UK National Support Centre staff in a staff meeting in the first quarter of 2019. There are currently eight members on the Board. The Board comprises an independent Chairman, two executive directors (including the Group Chief Executive Officer), three investor nominated board members (who are nonexecutive directors), and two other non-executive directors, one of whom is independent. A biography for each member of the Board can be found on our website https://www.busybeeschildcare.eo.uk/management-team. The size and structure of the Board is framed by the investment agreement in place between the Group's investors {Investment Agreement), with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan {OTPP), which holds a controlling interest in the Group, entitled to appoint such number of non-executive directors as it chooses, as well as the Chairman and an independent non-executive director. Esta Investments Pte Ltd (Temasek), OTPP's co-investor in the Group, is entitled to appoint one non-executive director to the Board. The Chairman sets both the annual agenda and the agenda for each Board meeting and encourages an open and constructive debate at Board level. The Group Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the implementation and delivery of the strategy agreed by the Board. The Board maintains a Board composition summary, which reviews and considers the skills and experience the various Board members bring to decision making. Diversity of background, experience and skillset at Board level is important to the Group and the need to achieve balance of views and influence is key (and considered by reference to the composition summary) when appointing new members to the Board. The non-executive directors bring judgement on key issues affecting the Group and its business operations, including strategy, performance, resources (including key appointments) and standards of conduct. They also bring experience in branding/marketing, M&A, international growth, talent management and headline risk and government policy, in addition to perspectives and challenge from outside the sectors in which the Group operates. The Board aims to have two independent non-executive directors in place on the Board (including the Chairman), to be independent of the Group's executive management and free from any business or other relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement. The Board did not have a second independent non-executive director for much of the financial year, following the resignation of David Anderson in February 2019. The Group addressed this in early 2020, with the appointment of Jane Holbrook to the Board as an independent non-executive director. 
The Investment Agreement also entitles OTPP and Temasek to invite observers to Board meetings, which they did regularly during the financial year, to provide a further combination of skills and judgement.


Each member of the Board is required to make the Board aware of any significant commitments outside the Group. They are also required to notify the Chairman if they become aware of actual or potential conflict situations, or situations which might impact the time they are able to devote to their directorship role for the Group. Both the non-executive directors and the Board observers meet regularly with the Group's management team to ensure they understand the needs of the business. These meetings include visits to the Group's centres, both in the UK and the other territories. There is an induction programme for all new members of the Board, which is tailored to their specific experience and knowledge and which provides access to all parts of the business. The Chairman conducts an annual informal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, looking at the leadership of the Chairman (in setting the agenda and directing discussions), the composition and skillset of the Board as a whole as well as specific matters such as review of risk, management accountability, financial performance and talent management. The Board considers these assessments important in the identification of key areas for future improvements, focus and for strengthening its overall performance, with assessments shaping the annual agenda for Board meetings in the following year. The Board is responsible for creating the framework within which the Group operates and is collectively responsible to the Company's investors for the direction, promotion and oversight of the Company to ensure its long-term success. It provides leadership for the Group, setting controls and standards. Other core activities include monitoring performance, and approval of material business development (including through acquisition) and commitments. The Investment Agreement dictates matters which are subject to OTPP nominated director or investor (OTPP) consent and sets out the terms of reference for Board committees. Matters which must also receive the consent of the OTPP investor director and/or OTPP include: 
• • • • • 
Structure and capital Approval of dividends Acquisitions 
Financial and accounting controls Material projects and contracts 
• Group business plan 
The Board delegates authority for the running of the Group's business to the Group management team (Group Management), led by the Group Chief Executive Officer. A biography for each member of Group Management can be found on the Group's website at https://www.busybeeschildcare.co.uk/management-team. The Board also delegates some of its functions to Board committees: The Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee.

The Board has an annual calendar of meetings, with the timetable set in the prior year to ensure that at least six meetings are held, as required by the Investment Agreement. An outline agenda is set at the start of the year, with standing agenda items including: • The Group Chief Executive Officer's report on strategic and business developments, together with relevant updates from each of the Group's territories; 
• The Group Chief Financial Officer's report which includes commentary on financial performance against the Operating Plan for the year; and 
• The Group Business Development Director's ,review of business development opportunities for the Group. 
On a cyclical basis, the Board agenda will also include detailed assessments of Group strategy, business plans, governance, deep dives into Group territories and, where applicable, reports from the Board committees.


Board Information 
Board meeting papers (including the meeting agenda) are circulated in good time prior to Board meetings to allow the Board members time to review in advance. Board meeting papers include a board update, providing a summary financial and operational update for the Group. In addition to Board meeting papers the Board receives regular and timely infonnation (at least monthly) on all key aspects of the business including safeguarding matters, health and safety, people, risks and opportunities, the financial perfonnance of the business, strategy, operational matters, market conditions, all supported by Key Perfonnance Indicators (KPls). Key financial infonnation is collated from the Group's accounting systems. The Group's finance function is appropriately qualified to ensure the integrity of this infonnation and is provided with the necessary training to keep up to date with regulatory changes, and financial controls are reviewed by the Group's internal audit function which is staffed by one person. 
Other key infonnation is prepared by the relevant internal Group function. Processes for collecting data, as well as the reporting of that data, is reviewed on a cyclical basis by the Group's internal audit function with reporting provided to the Audit Committee. 
During 2019 the Board: 
• Approved the annual reports and financial statements for 2018. • Approved the Operating Plan for 2020. • Reviewed the Group Annual Review for 2019 (see more detail on this review in Opportunities and Risk below). 
• Reviewed and approved the Group's risk register, prepared by Group Management, taking account of level of risk and steps implemented to mitigate impact. 
• • 
Received regular and detailed reports on the Group's operating and financial perfonnance in each territory, with Group Management given the opportunity to present to the Board. 
Implemented a review of the incentive arrangements in place for the Group's Management and senior employees, approving the roll out of a long-tenn incentive plan in 2019. 
• Reviewed the success of the Group's development and growth strategy for 2018-2019. • Approved and monitored the launch of UP, the Group's online learning platfonn made available exclusively to its educators in 2019. 
• Was briefed regularly as to whether any environmental, safety or governance issues had arisen, along with the action taken and the related risk mitigation steps. 
• Approved a number of new developments and acquisitions across the existing territories in the Group, and the entry into of new territories in 2019, including the United States, Ireland and Italy. 
Opportunities and Risk 
Long tenn strategic opportunities are reviewed by the Board as part of the Group's annual Operating Plan review, presented to the Board before the start of every year. This review will consider key drivers for growth of the Group and improvement in adjusted EBITDA, including growth through development of new sites and acquisition, integration of acquired businesses, centre fees, occupancy and child to staff ratios in each territory, and investment in and management of people. The review also identifies key future opportunities, including: leveraging of new digital systems and tools to improve occupancy, impact of new funding regimes in territories to improve occupancy and income, and M&A activity. 
The annual review for the Group (Group Annual Review), presented to and approved by the Board at the end of every year, assesses the success of the Group in pursuing its strategic objectives and highlights new key objectives for the coming year. This review considers the strategic highlights for the year, as we well as highlights any lessons learned for each territory in the Group.


Opportunities and Risk (continued) The Group recognises that risk management is an essential activity for the Group, supporting the achievement of its strategic objectives. The Board and Group Management look to identify, assess and manage the key areas of risk on a proactive basis, embedding risk management into the culture of the Group without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. The aim for the risk management framework is that it is fit for purpose and uses the Group's skills and capabilities to the full. For effective risk management the Board ensures that there is a robust and formalised process across the Group. The policies that underpin this process support the Group, across all the territories, to manage risk. The Board gives ownership of the identification and management of risk to Group Management, with risks highlighted to and considered by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board (including mitigation actions). A consideration of the principal risks and uncertainties for the Group is set out in more detail on pages 5 to 6. The Group introduced, during the financial year, the Group financial controls and governance questionnaires and confirmations. The financial controls questionnaire and confirmation (FCC) requires each territory in the Group, on a quarterly basis, to confirm compliance with the Group's financial policies and to disclose any areas of concern that the Group should be aware of, highlighting areas that require further discussion. The FCC is designed to document the territory level confirmations required by the Board and to enable the territories to highlight areas of risk. The governance and compliance confirmation (GCC) requires each territory in the Group, on a bi-annual basis, to confirm compliance with the Group's policies and to disclose any areas of concern that the Group and Board should be aware of, highlighting areas that require further discussion. The compliance section includes a series of statements relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, GDPR, Modem Slavery, fraud, Code of Conduct, financial policies and procedures, litigation and audit and non-audit related work. 
Group Management maintain a Group risk register, with risks scored based on likely impact on the Group, and have a process in place to consider the action required to manage the risk to an acceptable level. The register is presented, considered (including management actions) and approved by both the Audit Committee and the Board. The Group has internal policies, training and procedures in place to ensure compliance with the Group's Code of Conduct and its other global policies, including Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Modem Slavery and the Reporting of Serious Incidents. All staff have access to these policies, with appropriate mandatory training in place (in many cases via e-leaming) to ensure compliance with best practice. The Reporting of Serious Incidents policy highlights to the Group the need to report serious incidents to the Board (including those with a potential reputational impact on the Group), with risk mitigation actions to be explained as part of the reporting process. The Group operates a Speak Up policy and supporting internal helpline to allow staff(and other key stakeholders) to confidentially raise any concerns about conduct. The Speak Up policy is distributed to all staff, who receive appropriate training on the key elements of the policy. Stakeholder Engagement The Board promotes accountability and transparency with all external stakeholders and with representatives of government and other opinion leaders, whilst maintaining an open and visible presence in the media. The Board understands that good governance and effective communication are essential on a day-to-day basis to deliver the Group's Vision and to protect the Group's brand, reputation and relationships with all stakeholders including investors, customers, employees, suppliers, lenders and the wider community. The Group is made ofa small number of territories, with governance of the business across the territories and the Group as a whole, including engagement with stakeholders, delegated to a large extent to Group Management, led by the Group Chief Executive Officer. This delegation is subject to a documented delegation of authority matrix, with defined authorities and levels, which are subject to regular review and monitoring by the Board and the Board Committees. Group Management carefully consider the impact of any decision making, in respect of their territory or the wider Group, and the consequences for affected stakeholders. This is, in large part and where possible, achieved by discussing the decisions with relevant stakeholders and balancing the different and sometimes conflicting positions.


Stakeholder Engagement (continued) Group Management report regularly to the Board on key decisions taken to enable the Board to review and monitor the effectiveness of their decision-making, in particular that sufficient balanced consideration is given to stakeholders. The Board is also kept informed of stakeholder views through the information prepared for and shared regularly with the Board, detailed in Board Information on page 8. 
Details of how our key stakeholders and how we engage with them are detailed below. Investors 
The Chairman and the respective investor directors ensure that the Board and the Group is made aware of the views of the significant investors. The Group attaches significant importance to maintaining an effective engagement with investors to ensure a mutual understanding of objectives and to deal with issues of concern. OTPP consent is required or certain key decisions (see page 9), with communication on these matters led by the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer. The Board and Group Management are also aware of and comply fully with the investor information requirements detailed in the Investment Agreement. 
Parents 
The Group is focussed on the business staying in touch with our parents and having regular communication through several channels helps ensure the achievement of the Group's Vision, to deliver the best start in life for each child. We have developed a customised CRM system to help shape the parent enquiry management journey, allowing us to send communication (both operational and marketing) to parents centrally or at a centre level. This CRM works hand in hand with our management system, which enables the business to keep its parents up to date with all key relevant information for the business. 
Understanding the parent journey is a focus for the Group and our investment in social listening (via Meltwater) enables us to keep abreast of both brand and social media comments. During the financial year we developed an inhouse feedback form for parents, which guides future direction and important learning for our relationship with our parents. The Group also encourages the fostering ofrelationships at centre level, with Parent Partnership Group's (including elected parents) meeting on a regular basis to encourage good communication between parents and the centre. 
The Board recognises how fundamental the relationship with parents is to achieve the Group's Mission. The Board ensures it is regularly briefed on key impacting issues and decisions such as pricing, quality and curriculum tools and initiatives, all of which is reflected in discussions on the annual Operating Plan detailed on page 3. 
Workforce The Group values open communication with its workforce and aims to consult on matters that effect workforce engagement. The Board identified, in 2019, the need to formalise feedback on engagement of the workforce in the Group (to ensure decision making could demonstrably take the views of the workforce), with the Group HR. function agreeing the scope of a workforce engagement survey with the Board for roll out in 2020. The HR. function is currently in the process of appointing an external company to create and distribute the engagement survey across the Group's workforce, the results of which will be presented to the Board with clear suggestions for actions to improve engagement, including goals so this can be measured. The Group has already been trialling pulse surveys in 2019 to consider specific workforce issues, including to better understand staff view of benefits. The aim of the wider engagement survey is to build on this discussion and consultation with the workforce to not only identify potential Group areas of opportunity but to also to identify local trends. The Group, with Board support and direction, also commenced a succession planning strategy in 2019, with the Group HR. function currently conducting a global senior level succession planning exercise. The result of this exercise will be presented to the Board to identify the Group's top talent and succession gaps for key roles in the business. The intention of this exercise is to encourage mobilisation of global talent and share skills across all territories, which also drives a wider workforce initiative in the form of the Group's Talent Exchange Programme. This is where educator level employees and centre managers are provided with the opportunity to apply to experience work and culture in other global territories for a three-week period. The Group's remuneration strategy is considered below on page 15.


Stakeholder Engagement (continued) This programme saw selected members of the workforce experiencing the business in the Group's Australia territory in 2019. The Group Management host for the programme provides the Board with feedback on the experience and wider lesson learned for the Group to improve the programme going forward. 
Whilst formal mechanisms to monitor and measure workforce engagement are in development (for roll out after the financial year), the Group's focus on creating an environment of continuous listening is demonstrated by its workplace feedback processes. These include workforce exit surveys and general feedback received from managers. This feedback resulted in the Group investing, in the UK, in a new HR system which is currently in development stage. Once established the technology investment will provide an interactive platform for staff to receive information from the Group and the Board, and enable easier access to relevant information. 
The Group is open and transparent with the workforce about any business concerns and areas of success. With managers in the Group highlighting the need for more operational and financial data and easier access to data, the Group invested in an Oracle based dashboard system in the UK to provide this on a monthly basis, including key KPI's on matters such as: 
• Occupancy • 
• • • 
Financial performance Staffing efficiencies Debt 
Staff turnover 
In addition to monthly data being available on dashboards, members of Group Management hold an annual update meeting for UK National Support Centre staff to attend where performance and department specific initiatives are presented. This also gives staff an opportunity to ask questions of Group Management about the business, its strategy and objectives. UK annual events are extended further to centre level managers where they are invited to attend an annual managers' awards ceremony, to recognise the achievements of the wider workforce during the year. The ceremony includes a Group update and a presentation on upcoming initiatives. The ceremony also provides an opportunity for networking, with senior managers (including Group Management) in attendance and available for managers to discuss issues of concern to them and raise questions. 
Suppliers 
Suppliers are managed by Group Management on both a territory and Group basis, with the Board briefed regularly on significant supplier relationships or issues. Significant suppliers are required to observe key procurement principles in order to be listed as a partner supplier, with tailored procurement principles communicated to these suppliers clearly at the outset and during the relationship, covering quality standards, service levels, payment, price and margin transparency. Each significant supplier is required to have a dedicated account manager, with a commitment to maintain regular meetings (at least quarterly) to assess the relationship and ensure consistent communication. All suppliers are required to commit to high ethical standards and policies, a process that is repeated annually by the Group. 
Sector Stakeholders - government and other regulatory bodies As a leading childcare provider in the UK, the Group places significant emphasis on its engagement with government 
representatives (local and central) as well as the key related regulatory and sector organisations. The Group has a dedicated external affairs and government relations officer, who leads this interaction, to share knowledge, challenges and issues on behalf of the Group and the wider sector. This engagement, which includes round table discussions, regular meetings as well as reactive meetings and discussions provides us with government thinking and advice around sector regulation but also enables us to share pre-policy views and guidance, the aim of which is to influence the direction ofregulation of the sector as a whole. The Board receives regular reports on all engagement with government across the Group, with the impact of external factors such as regulation of the sector and government funding of the sector reviewed and considered when making decisions around short term and long-term strategy for the Group.


Community and environment The Group engages with the community both centrally and locally, with centres directors given the autonomy to engage with their local communities to support local causes and issues. The Group entered into a two-year partnership with Child Bereavement UK in 2018, raising approximately £100,000 for the charity in 2019. The charity supports families and educates professionals when a baby or child of any age passes away, or when a child is facing bereavement, a cause close to our hearts as a Group. Centres are encouraged and supported to partner with local community causes, which includes working with local care homes (for example, to run collaborative sessions such as arts and crafts) and local fund raising (often for families using our centres). The Group launched, in 2019, an initiative in its UK centres to safeguard the children, staff, parents and visitors in its care, by installing automated external defibrillators, boosting survival chances for anyone having an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The launch was supported by first aid trainers from the Group's training business completing a nationwide roadshow, teaching lifesaving skills to staff and parents and raising awareness of CPR. Our centres in the UK also participate in local authority groups and Early Years forums to support community networks and to ensure we have a voice at both local as well as central government. The impact of the business on the environment is considered with initiatives to consider our carbon and energy usage in our centres, the aim of which is to improve efficiency. We also have a long-term project in the UK to install smart meters, to flag high usage centres, which we can then manage to achieve energy reductions. Key community initiatives are reported to the Board as part of the regular reporting structures in place. Lenders The Group, through the Group Management team and members of the Board, provide our lending syndicate with a quarterly covenant compliance certificate and monthly and quarterly accounts to ensure they are kept informed of business activities and progress. On an annual basis, the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer hold a lender presentation to provide them with an update on the Group and its strategy (both financial and operational) for the coming year. The Group also maintains·regular ad hoe dialogue with the lending syndicate throughout the year (predominantly through the agent) to inform them of acquisitions and any other material changes in the business. Remuneration The Group's remuneration structure for senior employees is set by the Remuneration Committee - see the composition of the committee and terms of reference at page 10. The Remuneration Committee's primary objective is to set remuneration at a level that will enhance the Group's resources by securing and retaining quality senior employees who can deliver the Group's strategic ambitions in a manner consistent with both its Vision and Mission and the interests of its investors. The Remuneration Committee approved the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for senior employees of the Group, including Group management, during 2019. The overriding objective of the LTIP is to incentivise the management team and to align their goals and rewards to those of the existing shareholders. The intention was to achieve this by linking their reward to the growth in value of the overall business. The L TIP includes a shadow equity bonus plan scheme, through Equity Participation Units (EPUs). The EPU is a bonus paid out to management on an exit by the investors, the aim being to incentivise participants on both the growth in equity value of the Group and local contribution to this growth. In 2019, the Group reported its Gender Pay Reporting. The Group is an active equal opportunities employer and promotes an environment free from discrimination, harassment and victimisation, where everyone receives equal treatment and career development regardless of age, gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation or disability. All decisions relating to employment practices (including remuneration) are objective, free from bias and based solely upon work criteria and individual merit.


Remuneration (continued) We continue to review and improve our internal salary scales to ensure fairness applies to any individual appointed into a role, this also includes a robust Pay Review and Approval Policy applicable to all levels within the organisation and accessible by all staff members. Starting salaries will be offered in line with Group pay scales, which are reviewed annually. Any salaries that are to be offered above the starting points must go through an approval process as detailed within the policy. 
Each job level has an entry rate of salary and a maximum salary. No member of staff will be paid below the entry rate of salary for their job level, and no salary should progress above the maximum for each job level - unless the correct authorisation is granted as set out in the approval process. 
The Group will detail in annual budgets, the percentage increases that can be awarded to the wider workforce each year. Managers cannot award pay increases which would breach the approved pay remit. Staff who are eligible to receive a bonus will have their bonus criteria set out to them in writing at the start of the relevant period, which will usually be at the start of the year or their contract if they start part way through. The Group commits to fair bonus objectives that are deemed to be achievable, with a goal to reward good performance that contributes to the overall financial success of the business. The following key roles are eligible to receive performance bonuses: • • 
Educators - based on regulatory inspection outcomes and internal quality audits Centre Directors - based on the KPis of their centre including financial performance and quality 
• Area Directors - based on their area KPis including financial performance and quality • 
• 
Operations Directors - based on their division KPis including financial performance and quality Senior department heads - based on Group financial performance and their specific personal objectives 
• Group Management - based on territory and Group financial performance and their specific personal objectives. 
Objectives and bonuses for Group Management are determined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee in line with the wider strategic objectives for the Group. The Board also receives regular and comprehensive briefings on wider workforce remuneration structures and changes.
