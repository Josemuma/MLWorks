Corporate governance 
Wates Principles The Wates Principles are a set of corporate governance principles developed in 2018 at the request of the UK Government by a coalition group of industry bodies and wider interest groups chaired by Sir James Wates CBE. The Wates Principles provide a high-level, flexible governance code for large privately held companies to adopt, comprising six short-form principles and associated guidance which the Company fully supports. 
The Company has developed a clear purpose over several years and uses its core strengths to generate sustainable value for the business. The Board combines the experience of non-executive Directors with senior management to drive business strategy and Board membership is regularly refreshed. A well-defined committee structure is in place with clear definitions of roles and responsibilities of members who are supported by expert advice from relevant business specialists. 
Processes for the recruitment and remuneration of the Company's Directors, senior managers and other employees operate within the Group's systems and controls, taking into account pay and conditions of the wider Group workforce and matters such as gender pay gap. 
The Strategic Report describes the Company's risk management systems, principal risks and risk appetite which together help the Board make appropriate choices when assessing business opportunities. 
The Board seeks to engage with the Company's stakeholders including its workforce and understands that meeting the needs of customers it critical to long-term success. The impact the Company has on external factors such as the environment is also an important driver of business strategy.
