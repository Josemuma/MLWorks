Corporate Governance Statement 
Pursuant to The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company is required to incorporate a statement of corporate governance arrangements in its Directors' Report, stating which corporate governance code the Company applied during the financial year, how it was applied and if it was departed from, the respects in which it did so and its reasons for so departing. 
The Board of Directors has adopted the Wates corporate governance principles for large private companies subject always to the continuing applicability of, and compliance with, other sources of corporate governance identified by its regulators as being applicable to the Company. 
The Company's section 172 statement demonstrates the fulfilment of the many of the Wates corporate governance principles. 
With respect to additional reporting required, the Board of Directors completed an internal evaluation of its effectiveness in June 2019 and monitors the key action points arising from that review through delegation to the Company's Governance Committee. The Company has adopted a diversity policy which is reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Board of Directors is supported by an Audit Committee, a Board Risk and Reserving Committee and a Governance Committee which report to it arid have terms of reference setting out the delegations of authorities to them. Risk and internal control frameworks are closely monitored by the relevant Board committees and the Board of Directors: where appropriate.
As a subsidiary company, executive remuneration structures are largely controlled by its parent companies. However, the Governance Committee received a presentation on AXA XL Remuneration Policy and Risk Management during the financial year, gave feedback for the purposes of the performance appraisals of the Executive Directors and considered all matters relating to remuneration required by its regulators.
