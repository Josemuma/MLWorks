Corporate Governance 
For the year ended December 2019, under The Companies (Miscellaneuos Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies (published by the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') in December 2018. These new corporate governance reporting requirements apply to company reporting for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2019 and Companies are able to adopt the Wates principles as an appropriate framework when making a disclosure regarding corporate governance arrangements. We have adopted the disclosure in our 2019 Report and Accounts and have set out below the details of how we have applied the principles: 
Â· 
Principle 1 - Purpose and leadership The Company adheres to Group's four-year Medium-Term Plan ('MTP'). The plan set out ambitious 
targets to strengthen our position as a leader in the global paper-based packaging industry.

It ensures we retain a world-class containerboard and corrugated system. Sustanability is a central part if the Group's strategy. During the course of 2019, the focus on climate change, plastics and sustanability has intensified. Smurfit Kappa has a central role to play in working with customers to reduce waste.
