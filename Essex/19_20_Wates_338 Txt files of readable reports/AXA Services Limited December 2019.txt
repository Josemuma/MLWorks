Corporate Governance 
For the year ended 31 December 2019, under The Companies (Misc.ellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies (published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in December 2018 and available on the FRC website). The Company has adopted the Wates Principles as an appropriate framework in which to disclose its corporate governance arrangements. 
Principle 1 - Purpose and leadership The Company's principal activities are described in the Strategic Report. 
AXA Services Limited is a subsidiary within the wider AXA Group ("AXA"), a worldwide leader in insurance. As one of the largest global insurers, AXA's purpose is to "empower people to live a better life". The Company is aligned to AXA's core values of Customer First, Integrity, Courage (we speak our mind and act to make things happen), and One AXA (being together and being different makes us better). 
AXA's values are underpinned by commitments to help influence the way decisions are made and how business is conducted. They guide how the Company serves its customers, interacts with suppliers, makes decisions and recruits, promotes and manages employees. The values and commitments drive the behaviours at AXA, defining and shaping the One AXA culture. _The directors consider AXA 's purpose and values appropriate to the Company and apply them to the business where relevant. 
The Company, AXA UK and AXA Insurance strive to be responsible employers, placing employee engagement at the heart of their business. Achieving this means creating a workplace built on AXA's values that fosters diversity and equal opportunities for all, promotes employee participation, encourages professional development, and supports employee well-being. The Company, AXA UK and AXA Insurance recognise the importance of workforce unions and engages with them regularly to m_aintain positive working relationships. Feedback is sought through quarterly Pulse surveys, where staff can provide their views on how the business is performing against its strategic objectives and key values. 
Diversity and inclusion are key to creating a culture of trust and respect. The UK Group has a Diversity & Inclusion Board, which meets quarterly and is sponsored by a member of the Management Committee. As well as news articles, biogs and vlogs, a number of local events are run across all locations within the AXA UK Group. These include workshops, panel discussions and talks with senior leaders. Diversity and inclusion focused forums are also held, providing UK Group employees with the opportunity to speak to senior leaders about topics that matter to them. 
The Company has access to five employee resource groups (ERGs) providing an opportunity for employee-communities to promote positive cultural change within the business and the Company participates in and facilitates these. The ERGs are focussed on Working Families, Gender Equality, Pride (supporting our LGBT community), BAME (focusing on the under-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic staff) and ABLE (raising awareness about disabilities and carers and promoting change and support). These ERGs help to influence AXA UK Group policies, recent examples include the introduction of a Transitioning at Work Policy and the Family Friendly Policy. 
Being part of a large global organisation, the Company understands that it has a vital role to play in being a responsible corporate citizen. The AXA Cares initiative is based on four areas: People, Community, Environment and Customer. AXA UK has a network of AXA Cares Champions around the business to help drive the corporate social responsibility mission. The Company's workforce has access to a community partnership programme (Hearts in Action) which is designed to link the business with local communities, as well as a community grant scheme and charity partnerships.
Entities in the AXA UK Group are committed to reducing their impact on the environment by actively managing energy, paper and water consumption, as well as carbon emissions and waste. The nature of insurance concerns protecting people from unexpected events and AXA is committed to using its business expertise to help build an understanding of the risks faced by individuals and society at large. To support this the AXA Research Fund was created in 2007 to encourage scientific research that helps understanding and prevention of environmental, life and socio-economic risks. 
The Company, AXA UK and AXA Insurance strive to build trusted relationships with customers and to always treat them fairly, providing commitment to our customers that the business delivers against its purpose (see Principle 6 - Stakeholders, on page 12). 

Principle 2 - Board composition 
The Board of AXA Services Limited comprises the AXA UK Chief Executive Officer, AXA UK Chief Financial Officer and two Executive Directors. The Directors consider the size and composition of the Board to be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the business. All directors have equal voting rights. The Company Secretary is the first point of contact for directors seeking advice and services. Directors. can also take professional advice at the Company's expense. 
The Company's directors continue to keep their knowledge, skills and familiarity with the business current and up to date by engaging with senior management, attending appropriate external seminars, and internal and external training courses. All new directors undergo individually tailored induction (depending on their current skillset, experience and knowledge). This is also designed to ensure that the collective Board has the correct tools to address and balance stakeholders' interests with the company's business needs. 
AXA UK values diversity and inclusion and continues to create and develop an inclusive culture. We are committed to ensuring equality of opportunities, with the aim of promoting diversity throughout the Company including at the most senior levels, with a diversity and inclusion agenda that goes beyond the protected characteristics of the Equality Act 2010. Recruitment processes (including those for directors) follow the diversity and equal opportunities policy. 

Principle 3 - Director responsibilities 
Accountability The Board delegates certain decision-making powers to Committees and individuals. This allows those with appropriate knowledge and industry experience to make effective decisions whilst Board oversight is maintained. The Board has adopted a Corporate Authorities document which clearly sets out the Board's terms of reference, matters that are reserved to the Board, signing authorities and delegation to Committees and individuals. This is reviewed at least annually (and whenever there is a significant change) and is considered and re-approved as necessary by the Board each year. Each Director has a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. 
The Company Secretary maintains a Register of Director's Interests, which is updated when a change occurs. All Directors complete a conflicts of interest questionnaire annually and are regularly reminded of their statutory duties and personal obligations to avoid conflicts. Directors are regularly reminded to disclose any additional interests of which the Board should be aware.
Committees 
The Board delegates certain of its duties to AXA UK Group Committees (Audit, Risk, Remuneration & Nomination), which operate under clearly defined terms of reference. Board Committees are chaired by Non-Executive Directors and the membership of the Audit and Risk Committees are comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. This allows the Non-Executives to constructively challenge the executives. The Independent Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no material business or relationships with the Company that might influence their independence or judgement. Although the Board delegates a range of tasks, the Board itself retains ultimate responsibility for the affairs and management of the Company. 
Integrity of information 
The Board receives reports from management at its meetings. It reviews the information provided and provides appropriate enhancements and challenge. Key financial information is collated from AXA UK's various accounting systems. AXA UK's finance function is appropriately qualified to ensure the integrity of this information and is provided with the necessary training to keep up to date with regulatory changes. Financial information is currently externally _audited by Mazars LLP on an annual basis, and financial controls are . reviewed by the AXA UK internal audit function. 
The Audit Committee is aware of, and comfortable with, the scope of work planned by the internal auditors. The Committee receives a summary of the proposed audit plan, highlighting the budget / resource available, the rationale for the plan, and any limitations in its scope. Once agreed by the Committee any significant changes· proposed to the plan are notified to the Committee by the Head oflnternal Audit. 

Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk 
The Board is responsible for strategic decision-making and risk management. In March 2019, the AXA UK pie Board decided to change the AXA UK risk governance structure by combining regulated entity board risk committees to form a single AXA UK Group Risk Committee to assist the Board in its responsibility for the oversight and management of risk. The AXA UK Group Risk Committee has adopted a forward-looking approach, anticipating changes in business conditions as well as reviewing the risk profile of the operating entities and the AXA UK Group as a whole. It also considers the effectiveness of its risk management framework, use of the capital model and relevant regulatory requirements. 
The AXA UK Group Risk Committee, which meets at least quarterly, is comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors, and ensures that inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed appropriately and in a timely manner. The Directors of the Company have considered the terms of reference and the membership of the AXA UK Group Risk Committee and concluded that it is an appropriate body to consider the Company's risks. The Board monitors and implements the Committee's decisions where appropriate. 
Opportunity 
The Company's success is closely connected to the success of AXA UK and AXA Insurance. It's activities are aligned to the AXA Insurance strategy, which is considered and agreed by the AXA Insurance Board annually. The Company's key operational risks and mitigations are outlined in the Strategic Report (on page 2). 
The AXA Insurance Chief Risk Officer has oversight of the Company and reports key risk matters directly to the Group Risk Committee, which establishes the risk control framework by validating both risk policy and risk strategy. The framework is based on the five following pillars and is cemented by a strong risk culture: Risk Management independence and comprehensiveness; Common risk appetite framework; Systematic second opinion on key processes; Robust Internal Model; and, Proactive Risk Management.
Responsibilities 
AXA Group has developed a formal set of standards (the "AXA Group Standards") in order to promote a consistent approach to governance, supported by an effective risk management framework. The Company has adopted and complies with all relevant AXA Group Standards, including those relating to internal control, risk management and solvency management. 
AXA UK (and in turn, the Company) has a comprehensive system of internal controls designed to ensure that executives are informed of significant risks on a timely and continuing basis, and have the necessary information and tools to appropriately analyse and manage these risks. 
The Company's systems and controls are designed to provide reasonable reassurance to the Board and senior management regarding the achievement of objectives, ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliable financial and non-financial reporting, and compliance with laws, regulations and policies. 

Principle 5 - Remuneration 
The Board delegates authority to the AXA UK Remuneration & Nomination Committee, which has clearly defined terms of reference and is responsible for making recommendations to the Board in accordance with the AXA Group Remuneration Policy and as required by regulation. In 20 I 9 the Committee was comprised of the Chairman of AXA UK, two Independent Non-Executive Directors and a Non-Executive Director from within the AXA Group. 
The AXA Group Remuneration Policy sets out the remuneration principles applicable to all AXA Group companies and their employees. It is designed to support the Group's long-term business strategy and to align the interests of its employees and other stakeholders by (i) establishing a clear link between performance and remuneration over the short-, medium- and long-term, (ii) ensuring that the AXA Group can offer competitive compensation arrangements across the multiple markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii) ensuring compliance with Solvency II regulations and any other applicable regulatory requirements. 
Pay is aligned with performance and takes into account fair pay and conditions across the AXA UK Group's workforce. Executive remuneration is" reviewed annually and in the event of significant change in the structure and size of the Company's operations, with reference to market data and trends. AXA UK has formally adopted the Willis Towers Watson methodology for job grading for all levels (executive and other employees), an approach that aligns with AXA Group. A full benchmarking review will next take place in 2021 ahead of the 2022 annual remuneration review process, unless significant changes occur in the meantime in the business and its structure. 
The AXA UK Group is an equal opportunities employer and promotes an environment of diverse cultures, ideas, people and perspectives. It reports on Gender Pay, has signed the Women in Finance Charter and demonstrates its commitment to gender equality by setting a target of 40% of senior management roles to be held by women by the end of 2020. This currently at stands at 30% across the AXA UK Group.


 Principle 6 - Stakeholders 
The Board understands that good governance and effective communication are critical factors to ensure our brand, reputation and relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities are effective and supportive of the way in wh.ich the Company wants to work. The Board participates in all relevant AXA UK Group engagement initiatives, delegating responsibility to group staff and Committees as appropriate. 
The Company's key stakeholders and how it engages with them are described in the Strategic Report (see pages 3-4). 
· Stakeholders 
Accountability and transparency are key with all external stakeholders and with representatives of government and other opinion leaders, whilst maintaining an open and visible presence in the media. The fundamental purpose of protecting people and empowering them to live better lives is demonstrated and supported in active engagement across industry bodies and our stakeholder community. 
AxA UK Group entities promote strong relationships with their network of suppliers which are managed through an AXA UK Group company-wide procurement approach to ensure economies of scale and collaboration with suppliers can be achieved. 
Ensuring there is a strong and positive regulatory relationship is key to achieving everything that is required. This is set by the tone at the top where continuous engagement with the regulator takes place. The tone adopted throughout the Company aims to maintain a strong, effective relationships with the FCA, working in a collaborative and transparent manner to enable good customer outcomes. Proper governance and effective communication are key in fostering these relationships. 
Employees

Employees are listened to through a structured programme of engagement call 'Pulse', which it taken quarterly, this is in addition to ongoing conversations. The surveys ask employees questions to gauge their confidence in the strategic direction of the firm, whether they see AXA 's values alive, to consider their own sense of empowerment and to measure employee satisfaction. 
Employees are actively encouraged to undertake suitable professional development. AXA UK also supports holistic employee wellbeing across the dimensions of physical, mental, financial and social health and a new proposition is being launched to our people in this space in 2020, including new benefit offerings.
