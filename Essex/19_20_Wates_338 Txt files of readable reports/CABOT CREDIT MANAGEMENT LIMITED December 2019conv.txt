Corporate Governance Statement 
CCM recognises that corporate governance provides the framework within which we form our decisions and build a business that Is focused on adopting long-term sustainable growth as well as delivering long-term value to all stakeholders. 
We started our journey of reviewing our governance arrangements during the year within the parent of the Company, Cabot UK Holdco Limited (uHoldco") with the aim of achieving more effective decision making within the board of Holdco ("Holdco Board") and at management and subsidiary levels across the group. This work wlll continue throughout 2020. We believe that how we do business Is as important as what we do. The Holdco Board sets the tone to achieve our results In a way that treats customers fairly and helps to strengthen communities and this is encapsulated in our "Financlal Recovery - Helping Each and Every Customer" mission statement. Our culture determines how we behave, how we make decisions and our attitude towards risk. It is also aligned with the Group's purpose, values and strategy. 
Part of the review of our governance arrangements last year included undertaking an exercise to assess how much of the UK Corporate Governance Code we comply with. Notwithstanding that, we set out below our assessment of how our corporate governance policies and processes operate to achieve the desired outcome for each principle of The Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies.

Prlnclple 2: Board Composition 
We have an appropriately sized Holdco Board comprised of a mixture of Executive and Non-Executive directors including an Independent Non-Executive Director with the appropriate balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge with individual directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The composition of our Holdco Board promotes effective decision making and supports the delivery of our company strategy.

Prtnclple 3: Director Responsibilities 
The Holdco Board and Individual directors have a dear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities and policies and procedures support effective decision-making and independent challenge. As part of our Governance review this year, we conducted a thorough review of the allocation and responsibility across the Holdco Board in relation to risk and compliance, audit and remuneration. As a result we separated our audit and risk committee to ensure independent challenge and reviewed and updated our Terms of Reference for each Statutory Committee of the Holdco Board comprising an Audit Committee, a Risk & Compliance Committee and a Group Remuneration Committee. 
We also commenced the review of our Group Delegated Authorities Framework and have taken steps to simplify this and align It with the regulatory governance that we have put in place with the introduction of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime applicable to our UK regulated businesses. This work will continue into 2020. In addition to this, we also commenced a review of our operational governance framework which Includes a review of our policies and this work will continue into 2020.

The Holdco Board endorses a culture of giving back time, skills and technology and approved a strategic objective in our 2020-2024 strategic plan to build a charitable culture within the Group.

We engage with our suppliers to help drive change in our organisation through innovation, promoting new ideas and ways of working, whilst working with our suppliers to ensure thatthey reflect the same values and behaviours that we expect from our own people. 
We also seek to bulld strong relationships with other key stakeholders In the areas in which we operate, such as regulators. Our directors take an active interest in these connections and participate where possible in building such relationships and leading the liaison between the Group and other trading organisations or associations. Since becoming fully authorised our two major UK Regulated entitles have maintained a strong open and transparent relationship with the primary UK regulator the FCA. This relationship has been based on a two way flow of lnfonnatlon which has aided the FCA to gain a more detailed understanding of our sector. This proactive approach will enable the Group to successfully negotiate the UK regulatory environment helping to avoid potential censor as well as seeking to shape regulatory policy. Our lrlsh regulated entity also takes a similar approach with the primary Irish regulator the CBI.
