Corporate governance 
The Group has adopted the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for large private companies in the year and we summarise our compliance below. The framework has 6 principles. These are: Principle 1- purpose and leadership; Principle 2 - board composition; Principle 3 - director's responsibilities; Principle 4 - opportunity and risk; Principle 5 - remuneration, and Principle 6 - stakeholders. 
The Group's values, strategy and culture are driven by the Board as demonstrated throughout this Strategic Report and the Directors' Report. The Director's responsibilities are disclosed in the Director's Responsibilities section of these financial statements. The Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of this Strategic Report specifically shows our assessment of risks and our mitigations. Our Board have significant experience and contacts with our industry which ensures that we are well placed to identify and react to opportunities as they arise. The Board members have clearly defined responsibilities and accountability, and key decisions are made by individuals with requisite skill and knowledge. The Board receives regular financial information supported by Key Performance Indicators (KPls). The Board has developed a strategy and business model to generate long term sustainable value to the stakeholders and is responsible for ensuring the strategy is implemented, and in line with the group's values and practices. Our Board composition is shown in the Director's Report, and Director's remuneration on page if Board remuneration is approved by our principal controlling shareholder. 
A key focus of the Group is the management of stakeholder relationships, and engagement with our stakeholders. Our adherence with S172 (1) of Companies Act 2006 regarding stakeholder engagement is specifically highlighted in this Strategic Report.
