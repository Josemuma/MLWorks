A. The Board The Board is responsible for ensuring the business is able to take decisions, operate independently and run in a way that promotes the long term success of the Group, creating and delivering sustainable value. The Group has independent governance arrangements which take account of industry best practice. 
The Board’s role is to provide leadership of the Group within the boundaries of Risk Appetite and a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risk to be identified, assessed, measured and controlled. 
The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims and Risk Appetite to support the strategy, ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives. The Board has established a set of matters reserved for the Board and an annual rolling agenda to ensure control over key decision making. In the course of 2019, the Board reviewed and approved a number of strategic initiatives including an extension to the Group’s long term financial services partnership with the UK Post Office, the annual operating plan, capital and liquidity assessments, provided oversight of the culture programme and the customer plan, and played a key role in all material decisions. During 2019 the Board met 10 times. 
The Board comprises a mix of Executive Directors; independent Non-Executive Directors; and Non-Executive Directors from the Parent. The Board considers a Board size of 10 Directors appropriate to meet the requirements of the business and allows for a good balance between having the full range of skills necessary on the Board, and to populate its committees and retain a sense of accountability by each Director for Board decisions.

Upon appointment, each Director receives a detailed and tailored induction, including a briefing on directors’ duties. 
Prior to the appointment of a Director, the Nomination Committee assesses the time commitment involved and identifies the skills and experience required for the role, having regard to Board succession planning. The recruitment process for Non-Executive Directors is supported by an experienced third party professional search firm which develops an appropriate pool of candidates and provides independent assessments of the candidates. The Nomination Committee then shortlists candidates, conducts interviews and completes comprehensive due diligence. The Nomination Committee then makes a recommendation to the Board. 
During 2019, the Nomination Committee reviewed and updated its Director Assessment Policy and Board Diversity Policy.
