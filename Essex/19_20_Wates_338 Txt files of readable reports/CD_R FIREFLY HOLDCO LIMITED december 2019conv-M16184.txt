Corporate Governance 
In June 2018 the Government introduced secondary legislation requiring all companies of a significant size to report on their corporate governance arrangements for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. Full details are contained within the Governance report set out on pages 18-24 which forms part of this directors' report and is incorporated into it by cross reference. 
The directors agreed that the Group should adopt and follow the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for large private companies. This is a voluntary framework which adopts the 'comply or explain' approach. 
The approach is based upon six broad principles which the directors have adopted, they are:
• Purpose and leadership - An effective board develops and promotes the purpose of a company and ensures that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. 
• Board composition - Effective board composition requires an effective chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge, with individual directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The size of a board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company. 
• Director responsibilities - The board and individual directors should have a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The board's policies and procedures should support effective decision-making and independent challenge. 
• Opportunity and risk - A board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 
• Remuneration - A board should promote executive remuneration structures aligned to the longterm sustainable success of a company, taking into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the company. 
• Stakeholder relationships and engagement - Directors should foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the company's purpose. The board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement with stakeholders including the workforce, and having regard to their views when taking decisions.
