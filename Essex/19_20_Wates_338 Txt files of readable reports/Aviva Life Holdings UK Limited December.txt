Statement of Corporate Governance Arrangements 
For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies (the "Principles") . We set out below how the Principles have been applied during 2019. Principle 1 - Purpose and leadership 
Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited is part of the Aviva Group. Following the appointment of Maurice Tulloch as Group CEO of Aviva pie in March 2019, the Group embarked on a strategic review aimed at optimising our organisational structure around creating excellent outcomes for our customers. Our purpose is to be 'with you today, for a better tomorrow' and we include our customers, employees and our other stakeholders in this. The Group has set out three strategic priorities which will enable us to fulfil our purpose: 
Deliver great customer outcomes Excel at the fundamentals Invest in sustainable growth 
The Board has made a number of strategic decisions through the year which are aligned to this purpose including the decision to split the UKI business into separate UK Life and General Insurance business units. The Board has confirmed Savings and Retirement as a core growth opportunity together with Workplace benefits and Individual Protection and Health leveragingAviva'sconsiderableexpertise in these areas to the benefit of all our customers. Following the separation of the UK Life and General Insurance businesses, the Board took the decision to divest its shareholding in Aviva UK Digital Limited ('UKD') so that the overall ownership of UKD could be transferred to Aviva Insurance Limited, to align with the operational control of that business, and to enable UK Life to focus on its key strategic priorities. 
The Board monitors the culture of the organisation and raises any concerns during meetings and the Board is able to express its views on the culture of the organisation through the Board Effectiveness Reviews. Culture Ml has been added to the Board's annual planner to ensure the Board has the opportunity to review culture metrics and that employees have the right values, attitudes and behaviours and are focussed on doing the right thing for the customer. The Company complies with the Senior Managers' Certification Regime which further strengthens the drive for individual accountability. Employee engagement is sought through the Voice of Aviva employee surveys the output of which is reviewed by the Board and an action plan put in place to address areas identified by employees which may require further focus.

The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, taking into account other stakeholders as defined by Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006; further information on this can be found in the Strategic report. The Board is also responsible for setting the business strategy ,monitoring performance against its strategic aims and setting the Company's risk appetite and monitoringthe establishment and operation of prudent and effective controls. The Board also sets, monitors and upholds the culture, values, standards, ethics, brand and reputation of the Company to ensure that its obligations to its shareholders, employees, customers and others are met; monitors compliance with corporate governance principles; and ensures adequate succession planning for the Board and senior management to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Company and on the Board. 
Principle 2 - Board Composition Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited Board ('the Board') has a separate Independent Non-Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making across the UK Life business is effectively maintained. The Directors have equal voting rights when making decisions, except the Chair, who has a casting vote. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
The Board has a skills matrix in place to ensure the composition of the Board contains the appropriate combination of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge to understand and guide the business. The skills matrix is a key tool in any Board recruitment process to ensure the most suitable candidates are put forward for appointment to fill any gaps identified and to maintain a focus on succession plan ni ngto ensure the composition of the Board remains appropriate. 
The Board is comprised of both Independent Non-Executive directors and Executive directors. The Board is responsible for organising and directing the affairs of the Company in a manner that is most likely to promote the success of the Company for its shareholders as a whole and in a way that is consistent with its Articles of Association, applicable regulatory requirements and current corporate governance practices. The Board has formal Terms of Reference which include matters which it reserves to itself which are reviewed and updated annually. 
The Board undertook a formal effectiveness review of its performance, facilitated by Lintstock, in 2019, which comprised both a detailed questionnaire and individual interviews. The results were produced by Lintstock and presented to the Board at its meeting on 10 October 2019. Overall the review assessed that the Company was operating effectively and the Board had a good understanding of the Company's stakeholders and customers. The composition of the Board was deemed appropriate with the right skills and expertise on the Board to support the company through its strategic journey, although the lack of diversity on the Board was noted. The Board evaluation tracker was subsequently refreshed to include new actions arising from the 2019 Evaluation process and will be updated on an ongoing basis throughout the year and shared regularly with the Board. The next independent assessment will take place in mid-2020. Overall, the 2019 Board Effectiveness Review assessed that the Company was operating effectively with a number of areas prioritised for focus during the coming year.
