   Chair's introduction to governance I am pleased to introduce this report, which describes the activities of the Board during the year, along with SGN's governance arrangements. Covid-19 The Board continued to closely consider the impact of Covid-19 on our business. Our main focus has been to ensure the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public while continuing to maintain our essential service; safely delivering warmth and power to homes and industry at all times. Our robust governance framework has helped to support this work. RIIO-GD2 SGN is an award winning gas network company with a strong track record of delivering a safe and efficient supply of natural and green gas to 5.9 million customers. 2021/22 was the first year of the five-year regulatory period covering 2021 to 2026 known as RIIO-GD2. SGN has formulated a comprehensive and robust business plan for RIIO-GD2 carefully reflecting the views of many stakeholders and in particular customers. In February 2021 the Board took the decision to refer four elements of Ofgem's December 2020 Final Determination of our GD2 Business Plan to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). In its conclusions announced in October 2021, the CMA found in our favour on factors relating to two of the elements we appealed. As we move forward with RIIO-GD2, we are committed to delivering operational excellence and outstanding service for all our customers while also working with Ofgem, the UK and Scottish governments and other industrial partners to establish the role that hydrogen and biomethane can play in meeting the net zero target. Shareholder divestment The sale of their shareholdings by SSE, ADIA and OMERS, in two separate transactions completed in March 2022, brought two new investors into the Company namely Canadian global asset manager Brookfield, taking on a 37.5% share and US based Global Infrastructure Partners, a leading global, independent infrastructure fund manager, now with a 25% share. As part of these transactions, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, our third original investor, increased its ownership from 25% to 37.5%. Board appointments Following the share sale, the Directors from SSE, ADIA and OMERS stepped down from the Board in March 2022. I am pleased to welcome the incoming Directors nominated by the new shareholders: Michael Botha, Becky Lumlock, Felipe Ortiz, Martin Catchpole, Paul Trimmer and Christian Fingerle. Details of all Directors along with the alternate Directors can be found on page 86 from which it can be seen we have a Board with a broad range of relevant experience and expertise. Governance As a Board, we remain committed to high standards of corporate governance and believe that these high standards are central to the effective management of the SGN Group and to maintaining the confidence of our stakeholders. The following pages provide information on the composition of the Board and its governance structure and processes, together with reports from each of its committees.    Wates and compliance with code SGN, under the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. This report sets out how the Wates Principles were applied. Corporate governance requirements For the year ended 31 March 2022, under the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the SGN Â·Group has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies, published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in December 2018. A full copy can be viewed on its website under www frc org uk/directors/ corporate-governance-and-stewardship/ governance-of-large-private-companies. SGN and the Wates Principles for large privately owned companies 1. Purpose and leadership An effective board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. 2. The Board has considered the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (the 'Regulations'). For accounting years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, companies which meet certain thresholds are required to report under four corporate governance reporting regimes: 1. Employee Engagement -A statement on how Directors have engaged with employees and how Directors have had regard to employee interests (see page 43 and Directors' Report on page 97). 2. Stakeholder Engagement -A statement on how Directors have engaged with stakeholders and how Directors have had regard to stakeholder interests (see pages 42 to 50 and Directors' Report on page 97). 3. Section 172 - A statement on how Directors have had regard to their Section 172 duty to promote the success of the Company, as set out in the Companies Act 2006 (see page 46). 4. Corporate Governance -A statement on the Company's Corporate Governance Arrangements and how these have been applied (see pages 77 to 84). The SGN Group has adopted all four of these reporting regimes (Corporate Governance Requirements). In readiness, the Company has established a governance programme to ensure Directors both at Group Board and subsidiary Board level are able to comply with these Corporate Governance Requirements. Board composition Effective board composition requires an effective chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge, with individual directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The size of a Board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company. The Wates Principles provide a framework for the SGN Board to monitor corporate governance of the SGN Group and see where governance standards can be raised to a higher level across the business. We believe this, in turn, will result in better engagement with our stakeholder base. The governance framework will also provide the right environment for the Board to make decisions for the long-term success of the SGN Group. The tables on pages 79 to 81 summarise the six Wates Principles and indicate where more information can be found in the strategic and the governance reports. Throughout FY 2022/23, the Board will continue to review and challenge how the SGN Group can continue to improve its corporate governance. 3. Director responsibilities The board and individual directors should have a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The board's policies and procedures should support effective decision-making and independent challenge. 4. Opportunity and risk A board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 5. Remuneration A board should promote executive remuneration structures aligned to the long-term sustainable success of a company, considering pay and conditions elsewhere in the company. 6. Stakeholder relationships and engagement Directors should foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the company's purpose. The board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including the workforce, and having regard to their views when taking decisions.    Principle 1. Purpose and leadership An effective Board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures that its values, strategy, and culture align with that purpose. Summary Our purpose is to serve our communities by keeping everyone safe and warm. It's why we exist. Our values are safety, innovation, reliability, openness and respect. Our vision is to give our customers the best clean energy experience. The Board is responsible for ensuring that values, strategy and culture are aligned with our corporate purpose. Our strategy embeds our purpose, vision and values as key elements to ensure our stakeholders' interests are central to our long-term success. What we did in FY 2021/22 and what we plan to do in FY 2022/23 During the financial year, SGN's employees, the Executive Committee and the Board were engaged to establish the new purpose, vision and values as represented above. More than 1,300 colleagues were involved in this engagement programme. Throughout we have worked with our stakeholders to ensure we are delivering our business plan in RIIO-GD2. Looking ahead to FY 2021/22, we will embed our new purpose, vision and values and make sure our workplace culture is consistent with these values and our developing ESG reporting framework.

Principle 2. Board composition Effective Board composition experience and knowledge, valuable contribution. requires an effective Chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, with individual Directors having sufficient capacity to make a The size of a Board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the Company. Summary The Board comprises eight Non-Executive Directors, including a separate Chair to the Chief Executive, to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making across the Group are effectively maintained. The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary attend each Board meeting. Two Independent Non-Executive Directors also sit on the subsidiary Boards of Scotland and Southern Gas Networks pie. The Independent Non-Executive Directors bring outside experience in utilities, energy policy and finance, and provide constructive challenge and influence. The composition of the Board is partly determined by the Shareholders' Agreement, and it is considered to be in the best interests of the Group for the CEO, CFO and each shareholder to be represented at meetings. We consider that there is an appropriate combination of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge that promotes accountability. What we did in FY 2021/22 and what we plan to do in FY 2022/23 Towards the end of financial year, and as a result of the share sale by SSE, ADIA and OMERS, six new Directors have been appointed to the Board who bring a wealth of experience and come from a range of background. All new Directors have undertaken a comprehensive induction programme led by each executive team member to introduce them to SGN. For FY 2022/23 the Board remains committed to improving diversity throughout the Company in terms of gender, ethnicity, disability and age, and its People and Reward Committee and is actively engaging with the Shareholders to ensure that diversity and inclusion remains a key objective for the selection and appointment of shareholder appointed Directors.

Independent Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge to the Board's decision-making process. What we did in FY 2021/22 and what we plan to do in FY 2022/23 The Board continues to be supported by the work of the Board Committees. During the year, a review of the Board Reserved Matters was completed and continues to be rolled out, to ensure the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making is maintained between the Executive Committee, Board and new subsidiary companies within the Group, as the Group continues to grow and diversify. In FY 2022/23, once the new Board has become fully embedded, a Board effectiveness review, will be undertaken. A review of the Board training schedule is also planned to ensure the training provided to the Board remains robust and relevant for each year and will also be aligned with any training needs identified following the outcome of the Board effectiveness review. Where you can find further information Full details of how Directors fulfil their roles and discharge their responsibilities are found on pages 96 and 97. Principle 4. Opportunity and risk A Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. Summary The SGN Board seeks out opportunity while mitigating risk. Long-term strategic opportunities and high value investments are presented to the Board. The Executive Committee ensures that inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed appropriately and in a timely manner updating the risk register for any changes in underlying conditions and reporting this through to the Board. Operational and safety risks are regularly reviewed by the Risk and Resilience Committee and financial risks by the Audit Committee. What we did in FY 2021/22 and what we plan to do in FY 2022/23 The Board formally reviewed and challenged the key strategic risks both at the half and full year point. This encompassed a formal review of emerging risks taking insights from independent sources to help shape this discussion. The Board reviewed the risk appetite and target risks in FY 2021/22 to ensure these reflect the RIIO-GD2 plan and pathway to decarbonisation. The Board also reviewed key investment opportunities. In FY 2022/23 key strategic risks are again on the Board Agenda at both the half and full year points and key investment opportunities will continue to be reviewed by the Board throughout the year. The Group risk management framework is being reviewed in 2022/23 and any key changes proposed to the framework will be considered and agreed by the Board.

The Committee takes advice from independent external consultants who provide updates on legislative requirements, best market practice and remuneration benchmarking. The primary objective is to set remuneration at a level that will enhance the Group's resources by securing and retaining quality people who can deliver our Strategic Pillars and long-term value for its existing and future customers, stakeholders and shareholders. What we did in FY 2021/22 and what we plan to do in FY 2022/23 In FY 2021/22, the Board (following a recommendation from PARCO) approved the annual salary review of all employees for cost of living and agreed to proposed changes to both the short-term and long-term incentive plan framework for the Financial Year ensuring these measured both the financial and non-financial performance. The Board also approved a thank you payment to all employees (excluding the Executive) for their commitment and hard work during Covid-19. In FY 2022/23 with the support of PARCO the Board is committed to ensure the talent and succession for the Group's Executive is suitable for the group's long-term success and diversity and inclusion plays a key role across the Group.

Governance framework The successful execution of this strategy and oversight of its delivery are supported by clear Board protocols and a governance framework that defines relevant decision making authorities and responsibilities. Formally, these authorities and responsibilities are documented within: SGN's Articles of Association; Shareholder Agreement; the schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board; the terms of reference for the Committees; and the financial approval framework.

Roles and responsibilities for each Board Member, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Group Company Secretary can be found on page 85 followed by their biographies on pages 86 to 89. Board Committees During the year the Board was directly assisted in the discharge of its duties by five Board Committees and dedicated RIIO-GD2 Board meetings, whose remit, authority and composition are monitored to ensure continued and appropriate Board support. Each of the Board Committees provides dedicated focus to a defined area of responsibility. Board Committees act as an advisory body, with the Board retaining oversight and final decision making, except where otherwise Audit Committee 'AC' SGN Place Subsidiary Boards Stakeholder, Environment and Customer Committee 'SECC' Net Zero Committee __.

Membership will assess technical skills, knowledge and experience whilst recognising the benefits associated with diversity. Each Board Committee is chaired by a Non-Executive Director. Further information on the Board committees are set on pages 91 to 95. Board effectiveness The Group Company Secretary, Chief Executive Officer and newly appointed Chair conducted a governance review and gathered Board feedback on its effectiveness including areas such as Board paper quality, timeliness. Board meetings and engagements for the financial year. From this, a governance action plan for 2021/22 has been developed focusing on areas of continuous improvement for the Board. As part of this, the Board will have a strategy day which will focus on unregulated growth and energy transition arrangements. Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Below the Board, executive responsibility rests with John Morea, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Mick Carmedy, Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO and CFO Board and Executive reporting cycle are each employed by the Group and are not Directors of the Company although attend each Board meeting. They are supported by an Executive Committee. Biographical details for the CEO and CFO are set out on page 89. Executive Committee Day-to-day management of the Company is delegated to the Executive Committee which meets monthly and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and whose membership includes the Chief Financial Officer and leaders of each business unit. The Executive Committee is in turn supported by its own operational and assurance framework, with defined roles and responsibilities including relevant delegated authorities. Board and Executive reporting To ensure that all decision making is well-informed, transparent and balanced, careful consideration is given to information provision and flows within the governance framework. During the year the Group Company Secretary worked with Board Intelligence Limited to provide refresher training to Board and Committee paper authors on best practice paper writing to support the provision of high quality information and effective decision making. This exercise involved reinforcing the use of best practice paper templates which seek to help focus the Board on what matters (including checks against its Section 172 duties). Refresher training on dashboard reporting (displaying key performance data and rapid insights on the overall health of the Group) was also provided to streamline reporting across the Group at a Committee level. Board information is distributed digitally, instantly and securely via the Board Intelligence platform once available. The Group Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timeliness and quality of information. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary. Biographical details for the Group Company Secretary are set out on page 89. Conflicts of interest With effect from 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 has introduced a statutory duty on Directors to avoid conflicts of interest. During the year, the Group Company Secretary formally reviewed all the Directors' reported actual and potential conflicts of interest. The Board then considered and recorded each Director's reported actual and potential conflicts of interest. In addition, conflicts of interest and governance are included as standing agenda items for every Board Meeting. The Group Company Secretary periodically reviews the Board protocols and governance framework to confirm that they remain fit for purpose and considers any initiatives which could strengthen the governance of the Company and decision making. Shareholders SGN has three supportive shareholders. The Board interacts with the shareholder members on a regular basis and always acts fairly with members of the Company. Board meetings There were six scheduled meetings of the Board and an additional three Board calls in 2021/22 in line with the agreed plan of business for the year, and details of Director attendance can be found on page 84. In the months between full Board meetings, a Board update call provides the opportunity to discuss key business developments, and emerging issues and opportunities. with arrangements also in place should a Board decision or approval be required outside of the above times. In total there were 9 Board meetings and calls during the year. Scheduled meetings of the Board follow an agreed format, with agendas being developed from the Board's annual plan of business and tailored to reflect the current status of projects, strategic workstreams and the overarching operating context. Finalisation of meeting content is a collaborative process involving the Chair, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and the Group Company Secretary, who ensure adequate time is allocated to support effective and constructive discussion. Board engagement The Board also ensures it spends time out of the Boardroom with stakeholders. During the year the Board was impacted by what physical engagement it could undertake due to social distancing, however the Board was able to undertake an employee engagement session with a number of employees towards the end of the year. The Board plans to resume stakeholder engagement sessions going forward. Full details of distanced Board engagement with stakeholders can be found on pages 82 to 84.    Board activity The Board splits its time between steering and supervising the organisation across strategy, performance and governance. With Board input, the Group Company Secretary has developed a focused set of priorities for the Board for the year (see page 90). The aim of developing priorities is to ensure the right items come to the Board at the right frequency to help focus on the issues that matter most to the Group and ensure meeting time is used effectively. The supporting Board papers for each agenda item focus on answering the key questions on the Board's mind. In line with the Board's responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the Group, strategy related issues are discussed at every Board meeting. During the year the Board spent a significant time considering its strategy over the next five years as part of the ongoing RIIO-GD2 as the outcome of the CMA appeal was awaited. As part of this, the Board has overseen a number of other strategy-related analyses, including, but not limited to: a review of SGN's pathway to the decarbonisation of heat, covering relevant trends in policy, technology, customer and stakeholder expectations; SGN's long-term financial outlook; assessment and prioritisation of growth opportunities; and a.review of SGN's key risks.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: â¢ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; â¢ state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; â¢ assess the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and â¢ use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Interest rate risk and inflation rate risk The Group has interest bearing liabilities and as a matter of policy, a minimum of 75% of debt, excluding shareholder loans, is maintained at either fixed rates of interest or inflation-linked. The Group uses interest rate swaps and inflation-linked swaps, where necessary, in order to achieve the desired profile. Liquidity risk The Group maintains a mixture of long-term funding and short-term liquid funds in order to ensure there are sufficient funds available for the Group's current and planned operations. Foreign exchange risk The Group's borrowings are currently denominated in Pound Sterling, so there is minimal foreign exchange risk. However, in accordance with its policy, should the Group decide to raise finance in currency other than Pound Sterling, cross-currency swaps would be used to fully hedge the borrowings into Pound Sterling. Credit risk The Company transacts with banks for the provision of interest rate and inflation rate hedging transactions. The Company takes reasonable steps to maintain a minimum credit rating requirement as set out in its hedging policy; however, it recognises that at times the market conditions for banks can be unusually tight. In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.

The Group's principal activity is the development, administration, maintenance and safe operation of the Gas Distribution Networks in Scotland, southern England and Northern Ireland and the supply of associated transportation, connection and metering services. It will continue these activities for the foreseeable future. Directors The Directors of the Company who served during the year ended 31 March 2022 and up to the date of signing can be found on pages 86 to 89. Directors' insurance and indemnities The Directors of the Company have the benefit of the indemnity provisions in the Company's Articles of Association. The Directors have been granted a qualifying third-party indemnity provision which was in force throughout the year. In addition, the Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year Directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of itself, the Group, the Directors and other senior executives of the Group. Principal risks The review of business for the year, including an analysis using key performance indicators and an indication of likely future developments in the business, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 51 to 57.    e Group's gas transportation charges are subject to price control formulae set within the regulatory regime. The Group's maximum allowed revenue in a given price period is dependent upon a number of factors that are not known in advance and, therefore, the maximum allowed annual revenue is not known until the end of the relevant period. However, transportation tariffs are set on a prospective basis, so actual revenue received or receivable in any one year may differ from the maximum allowed revenue. Where revenues received or receivable differ from the maximum allowed annual revenue, adjustments are made to future prices to reflect this over or under recover~ Going concern The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities together with the factors likely to affect its future performance and the Group's principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 12 to 76. The Group's financial risk management objectives and risk exposures are set out above. As stated in the Strategic Report the Group operates the regulated gas distribution networks in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The revenue of the Group is regulated by Ofgem (for the south of England and Scotland) and UREGNI (for Northern Ireland) through established price control mechanisms based on the distribution network capacity. The Group has considerable financial resources together with committed financing facilities as discussed in note 18 of the financial statements, to finance the current and future operations. The Covid-19 pandemic, the rise in gas prices, and the conflict in Ukraine have impacted the global economy and, in light of this, the Group has performed additional analysis of its going concern of the Group as a whole including performing scenario testing and sensitivity analysis. These forecasts show the Group would be able to operate within its available committed liquidity (cash and bank facilities). As a consequence, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least 12 months following the approval of the Annual Report & Accounts (i.e. until 31 July 2023). Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements. Disclosure of information to auditors Each of the Directors report confirms: at the date of this 1) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware; and 2) the Director has taken all the steps they ought to have taken as a Director, to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish the Company's auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. The auditor, be proposed forthcoming Ernst & Young LLP, will for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting.
