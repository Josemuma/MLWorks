   STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS The Board has considered the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (the 'Regulations'). Companies ,that meet certain thresholds are required to report under four corporate governance reporting regimes: 1. Stakeholder Engagement - A statement on how Directors have engaged with stakeholders and how Directors have had regard to stakeholder interests. 2. Corporate Governance - A statement on the Company's Corporate Governance Arrangements and how these have been applied. 3. Employee Engagement - A statement on how Directors have engaged with employees and how Directors have had regard to employee interests. 4. Section 172 - A statement on how Directors have had regard to their Section 172 duty to promote the success of the Company, as set out in the Companies Act 2006. The Company has adopted all four of these reporting regimes (Corporate Governance Requirements). In readiness, the Com.pany has established a governance programme to ensure Directors are able to comply with these Corporate Governance Requirements. Internal controls in relation to the Group's financial reporting process The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the Company's internal control systems and risk management. The Company's system of internal control and embedded risk management, which have been in place throughout the year, help to safeguard the assets and are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, material risks to the achievement of the business objectives. The Board recognises that these systems can,provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Accordingly, the Directors have regard to what controls, in their judgement, are appropriate to the business, to the materiality of the risks inherent in the business and to relative costs and benefits of implementing specific controls. Internal control is maintained through an organisation structure with clearly defined responsibilities, authority levels and lines of reporting, the appointment of suitably qualified staff in specialised_business areas and continuing investment in high-quality information systems. These methods of control are subject to periodic review as to their implementation and continued suitability. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the year covered by this report that has Â·materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Internal audit The Board of Directors has established the scope of the internal audit function which is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Company's systems of internal control and reports to the Audit Committee of the Board. The internal audit manager reports to the Audit Committee on the audit programme, progress against the programme and any follow-up actions on a bi-monthly basis.    Wates Principles For the year ended 31 March 2022, under the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the SGN Group, including Scotland Gas Networks pie has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies, published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in December 2018. A full copy can be viewed on the FRC's website. The Wates Principles provide a framework for the SGN Board to monitor corporate governance of the SGN Group and see where governance standards can be raised to a higher level across the business. We believe this, in turn, will result in better engagement with our stakeholder base. The governance framework will also provide the right environment for the Board to make decisions for the long-term success of the SGN Group. The six Wates Principles are as follows: 1. Purpose and leadership An effective Board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. 2. Board composition Effective Board composition requires an effective chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge, with individual Directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The size of a Board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company. 3. Director responsibilities The Board and indivi<;lual Directors should have a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The Board's policies and procedures should support effective decision-making and independent challenge. 4. Opportunity and risk A Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. 5. Remuneration A Board should promote executive remuneration structures aligned to the long-term sustainable success of a company, considering pay and conditions elsewhere in the company. 6. Stakeholder relationships and engagement Directors should foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the company's purpose. The Board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including the workforce, and having regard to their views when taking decisions.    Corporate Governance In the following section of the Directors' Report, we describe how we have applied the Wates Principles in line with its 'comply or explain' model and confirm full compliance with its principles for the reporting year ended 31 March 2022: Principle 1 - Purpose and leadership An effective Board develops and promotes the purpose of a company, and ensures that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose. Our purpose is to serve our communities by keeping everyone safe and warm. It's why we exist. Our values are safety, innovation, reliability, openness and respect. Our vision is to give our customers the best clean energy experience. The Board is responsible for ensuring that values, strategy and culture are aligned with our corporate purpose. Our strategy embeds our purpose, vision and values as key elements to ensure our stakeholders' interests are central to our long-term success. During the financial year, SGN's employees, the Executive Committee and the Board were engaged to establish the new purpose, vision and values as represented above. More than 1,300 colleagues were involved in this engagement programme. Throughout we have worked with our stakeholders to ensure we are delivering our business plan in RIIO-GD2. Looking ahead to FY21/22, we will embed our new purpose, vision and values and make sure our workplace culture is consistent with these values and our developing ESG reporting framework. Principle 2 - Board composition Effective Board composition requires an effective chair and a balance of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge, with individual Directors having sufficient capacity to make a valuable contribution. The size of a Board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company. The Board comprises eight Non-Executive Directors, including a separate Chair to the Chief Executive, to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making are effectively maintained. The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary attend each Board meeting. Two Independent Non-Executive Directors also sit on the Board of Scotland Gas Networks pie. The Independent Non-Executive Directors bring outside experience in utilities, energy policy and finance, and provide constructive challenge and influence. The composition of the Board is partly determined by the Shareholders' Agreement, and it is considered to be in the best interests of the Group for the CEO, CFO and each shareholder to be represented at meetings. We consider that there is an appropriate combination of skills, backgrounds, experience and knowledge that promotes accountability. Towards the end of financial year, and as a result of the share sale by SSE, ADIA and Omers, 6 new Directors have been appointed to the Board who bring a wealth of experience and come from a range of background. All new Directors have undertaken a comprehensive induction programme led by each executive team member to introduce them to SGN.    For FY22/23 the Board remains committed to improving diversity throughout the Company in terms of gender, ethnicity, disability and age, and its People and Reward Committee and is actively engaging with the Shareholders to ensure that diversity and inclusion remains a key objective for the selection and appointment of shareholder appointed Directors. Principle 3 - Director responsibilities The Board and individual Directors should have a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities. The Board's policies and procedures should support effective decision-making and independent challenge. The Company has a separate Chair and CEO to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making are effectively maintained. The Board receives regular reports on financial and operational performance, customers, people and stakeholders and management of key business risks along with updates on activities and decisions of its committees. Independent Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge to the Boards decision-making process. The Board continues to be supported by the work of the Board Committees. During the year, a review of the Board .Reserved Matters was completed and continues to be rolled out, to ensure the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making is maintained between the Executive Committee, Board and new subsidiary companies within the Group, as the Group continues to grow and diversify. In FY22/23, once the new Board has become fully embedded, a Board effectiveness review, will be undertaken. A review of the Board training schedule is also planned to ensure the training provided to the Board remains robust and relevant for each year and will also be aligned with any training needs identified following the outcome of the Board effectiveness review. Principle 4 - Opportunity and risk A Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value, establishing oversight for the identification and mitigation of risks. The Board seeks out opportunity while mitigating risk. Long-term strategic opportunities and high value investments are presented to the Board. The Executive Committee ensures that inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed appropriately and in a timely manner updating the risk register for any changes in underlying conditions and reporting this through to the Board. Operational and safety risks are regularly reviewed by the Risk and Resilience Committee and financial risks by the Audit Committee. The Board formally reviewed and challenged the key strategic risks both at the half and full year point. This encompassed a formal review of emerging risks taking insights from independent sources to help shape this discussion. The Board reviewed the risk appetite and target risks in FY21/22 to ensure these reflect the RIIO-GD2 plan and pathway to decarbonisation. The Board also reviewed key investment opportunities. In FY 22/23 key strategic risks are again on the Board Agenda at both the half and full year points and key investment opportunities will continue to be reviewed by the Board throughout the year. The Group risk management framework is being reviewed in 22/23 and any key changes proposed to the framework will be considered and agreed by the Board.    Principle 5 - Remuneration A Board should promote executive remuneration structures aligned to the long-term sustainable success of a company, considering pay and conditions elsewhere in the company. The People and Reward Committee has clearly defined terms of reference and is responsible for making recommendations to the Board concerning the Group's remuneration strategy, recruitment framework and long-term incentive plans for senior executives. The Committee takes advice from independent external consultants who provide updates on legislative requirements, best market practice and remuneration benchmarking. The primary objective is to set remuneration at a level that will enhance the Group's resources by securing and retaining quality people who can deliver our Strategic Pillars and long-term value for its existing and future customers, stakeholders and shareholders. In FY21/22, the Board (following a recommendation from PARCO) approved the annual salary review of all employees for cost of living and agreed to proposed changes to both the short-term and long-term incentive plan framework for the Financial Year ensuring these measured both the financial and non-financial performance. The Board also approved a thank you payment to all employees (excluding the Executive) for their commitment and hard work during Covid-19. In FY22/23 with the support of PARCO the Board is committed to ensure the talent and succession for the Group's Executive is suitable for the group's long-term success and diversity and inclusion plays a key role across the Group. A Talent Review is planned and will be combined with diversity and inclusion data. This will then be liised to feed into the review of the remuneration for key talent. Principle 6 - Stakeholder relationships and engagement Directors should foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the company's purpose. The Board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including the workforce, and having regard to their views when taking decisions. The Board is aware of the broader impact it has on its various environments, its customers and society in general, and has established corporate social responsibility policies and practices for the Group. The Board is committed to social responsibility, community engagement and environmental sustainability as underpinned by our strategic priorities. Our priority during this year has been our continuing focus on our core purpose, to keep everyone safe and warm, with the carbon impact of the gas network and creating a sustainable future for the business also becoming increasingly important priorities. Regular two-way engagement with our stakeholders has been central to this, and their feedback continues to shape our decision-making. Our stakeholder, Environment and Customer Committee (SECC) continued to meet during the year, taking account of stakeholder feedback and insight as they continued in their commitments to decarbonise the gas network and further develop our ESG strategy and reporting framework. We will continue to build our engagement by agreeing a formal, but dynamic, Board stakeholder engagement plan to ensure we continue to foster relationships and put stakeholders at the heart of how we deliver our business.    Our Board is led by our Chair, Nick Salmon, who was appointed on 1 March 2021 and is responsible for the effective running and management of the Board. The roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are separate, with clear divisions of responsibilities. Board of Directors The Board of Directors is comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors and is the principal decision-making forum for the Company. Directors are nominated to the Board in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders' and Governance Agreement. The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company and for setting of a clear purpose, vision and sustainable strategy which creates value for existing and future customers. stakeholders and shareholders. It provides the leadership necessary for the Company to meet its business objectives while ensuring a sound system of internal control and risk management is in place. The powers and the duties of the Directors are determined by legislation and by the Company's Articles of Association. The Board has also adopted a formal schedule of matters detailing key aspects of the Company's affairs reserved to it for decision. Board constitution and appointments The Board of Directors comprises eight Non-Executive Directors. This consists of a Non-Executive Chair and seven Non-Executive Directors. Each of the non-executive Directors are chosen for their diversity of skills and experience. The Non-Executive Directors scrutinise, measure and review the performance of management; constructively challenge and assist in the development of strategy; review the Company financial information; and ensure systems of internal control and risk management are appropriate and effective. Roles and responsibilities for each Board Member, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Group Company Secretary can be found on page 41 followed by their biographies on page 51. Board Committees During the year the Board was directly assisted in the discharge of its duties by five Board Committees and dedicated GD2 Board meetings, whose remit, authority and composition are monitored to ensure continued and appropriate Board support. Each of the Board Committees provides dedicated focus to a defined area of responsibility. Board Committees act as an advisory body, with the Board retaining oversight and final decision making, except where otherwise delegated by the Board in which case the Committee will act within their agreed authority. Board Committee membership is determined by the Board. Prior to determining membership, the Board will consider the subject matter of the Committee's purpose and duties to ensure that the membership addresses its specific needs. Membership will assess technical skills, knowledge and experience whilst recognising the benefits associated with diversity. Each Board Committee is chaired by a Non- Executive Director. Further information on the Board committees is set on pages 42 to 50    Board effectiveness The Group Company Secretary, Chief Executive Officer and Chair conducted a governance review and gathered Board feedback on its effectiveness including areas such as Board paper quality, timeliness, Board meetings and engagements for the financial year. From this, a governance action plan for 2021/22 had been developed focusing on areas of continuous improvement for the Board. As part of this, the Board had a strategy day which focused on unregulated growth and energy transition arrangements. Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Below the Board, executive responsibility rests with John Morea, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Mick Carmedy, Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO and CFO are each employed by the Group and are not Directors of the Company although attend each Board meeting. They are supported by the Executive Committee. Executive Committee Day-to-day management of the Company is delegated to the Executive Committee which meets monthly and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and whose membership includes the Chief Financial Officer and leaders of each business unit. The Executive Committee is in turn supported by its own operational and assurance framework with defined roles and responsibilities including relevant delegated authorities. Boa.rd and Executive Reporting To ensure that all decision making is well-informed, transparent and balanced, careful consideration is given to information provision and flows within the governance framework. During the year the Group Company Secretary worked with Board Intelligence Limited to provide refresher training to Board and Committee paper authors on best practice paper writing to support the provision of high-quality information and effective decision making. This exercise involved reinforcing the use of best practice paper templates which seek to help focus the Board on what matters (including checks against their Section 172 duties). Refresher training on dashboard reporting (displaying key performance data and rapid insights on the overall health of the Company) was also provided to streamline reporting across the Group at a Committee level. Board information is distributed digitally, instantly and securely via the Board Intelligence platform once available. The Group Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timeliness and quality of information. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary. Conflicts of interest With effect from 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 has introduced a statutory duty on Directors to avoid conflicts of interest. During the year, the Group Company Secretary formally reviewed all the Directors' reported actual and potential conflicts of interest. The Board then considered and recorded each Director's reported actual and potential conflicts of interest. In addition, conflicts of interest and governance are included as standing agenda items for every Board Meeting. The Group Company Secretary periodically reviews the Board protocols and governance framework to confirm that they remain fit for purpose and considers any initiatives which could strengthen the governance of the Company and decision making. Shareholders SGN has three supportive shareholders. The Board interacts with the shareholder members on a regular basis and always acts fairly with members of the Company.    Board Meetings There were six scheduled meetings of the Board in the year and three further Board calls in line with the agreed plan of business for the year, and details of Director attendance can be found on page 49. In the months between full Board meetings, a Board update call provides the opportunity to discuss key business developments, and emerging issues and opportunities, with arrangements also in place should a Board decision or approval be required outside of the above times. In total there were nineteen Board meetings and calls during the year. Scheduled meetings of the Board follow an agreed format, with agendas being developed from the Board's annual plan of business and tailored to reflect the current status of projects, strategic workstreams and the overarching operating context. Finalisation of meeting content is a collaborative process involving the Chair, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and the Group Company Secretary, who ensure adequate time is allocated to support effective and constructive discussion. Board engagement out of the Boardroom The Board also ensures it spends time out of the Boardroom with stakeholders. During the year the Board was impacted by what physical engagement it could undertake due to social distancing, however the Board were able to undertake an employee engagement session with a number of employees towards the end of the year. The Board plans to resume stakeholder engagement sessions going forward. Board activity The Board splits it's time between steering and supervising the organisation across strategy, performance and governance. With Board input, the Group Company Secretary has developed a focused set of priorities for the Board for the year. The aim of developing priorities is to ensure the right items come to the Board at the right frequency to help focus on the issues that matter most to the Company and ensure meeting time is used effectively. The supporting Board papers for each agenda item focus on answering the key questions on the Board's mind. In line with the Board's responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the Company, strategy related issues are discussed at every Board meeting. During the year the Board spent-a significant time considering its strategy over the next five years as part of the ongoing RIIO-GD2 as the outcome of the CMA appeal was awaited. As part of this, the Board has overseen a number of other strategy-related analyses, including, but not limited to: a review of SGN's pathway to the decarbonisation of heat, covering relevant trends in policy, technology, customer and stakeholder expectations; SGN's long-term financial outlook; assessment and prioritisation of growth opportunities; and a review of SGN's key risks.
