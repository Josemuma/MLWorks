Procedures have been designed for safeguarding assets, for maintaining proper accounting records; and for assuring the reliability of financial information used within the business, and provided to external users. Such procedures are designed to mitigate and manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement, errors, losses or fraud. The key procedures that have been established are designed to provide effective internal control within the CSi group. Such procedures for the ongoing identification, evaluation and management of the significant risks faced by the Bank have been in place throughout the year and up to 10 March 2022, the date of approval of the CSi Annual Report for 2021. The Risk Appetite Statement is formally reviewed and assessed at least once a year by the Board. Key risks are also formally reviewed and assessed on a quarterly basis by the Board Risk Committee and the Board as required. In addition, key business risks are identified, evaluated and managed by operating management on an ongoing basis by means of policies and processes such as credit and market risk limits and other operational metrics, including authorisation limits, and segregation of duties. The Board receives regular reports on any risk matters that need to be brought to its attention. Significant risks identified in connection with the development of new activities are subject to consideration by the Board. There are well-established business planning procedures in place and reports are presented regularly to the Board detailing the performance of each principal business unit, variances against budget, prior year and other performance data. The Board's duties relate to Strategy and Management; Culture; Risk Management; and Financial Reporting and Internal Control as set out in the Board Terms of Reference. During 2021 the Board has taken decisions in line with its duties and the Board objectives, including the review and approval of the Strategy and Financial Plan; the Risk Appetite Statements and Limits; the Country Risk Limit Framework; the ILAAP; the Contingency Funding Plan; the Board and Committee Objectives; the ICAAP; the Compliance Risk Assessment and Plan; the Financial Crime Compliance Risk Assessment; Authorised Signatories; the Financial Statements and Pillar 3 Disclosures; the Modern Slavery Statement; the Registration Document; Board Director Resignations and Appointment; the CSi Italian Branch Closure; the CSi SEC Security-Based Swap Dealer Registration; and Major Proj-ects. The Board has delegated execution of certain duties to the    Board Committees and escalated significant issues to CSG as required. Board Evaluation and Composition Each year, the Board undertakes a formal Board Evaluation against the responsibilities listed in its Terms of Reference and the Board's annual objectives to assess Board effectiveness and to decide on future objectives and focus topics in light of the CS group strategy, and to identify internal briefings / training required by individual Directors. The Evaluation assists the Board Nomination Committee to assess the composition and performance of the Board, and the knowledge, skills, experience and diversity of Board members and the Board succession plan. From time to time, the Board will mandate an external advisor to facilitate the evaluation; usually the evaluation is internal for two years and external for every third year (last performed for the 2020 assessment). At the beginning of 2022, the Board performed a self-evaluation of its own performance in 2021. The 2021 self-assessment concluded that the Board and Board Committees are operating effectively. The Board has approved updated Board and Board Committees' objectives for 2022. Board Training In addition to an initial Board Director Induction, Board Directors undertake internal briefings and training, which are tailored to CSi's business strategy, Board objectives and decisions to be taken by the Board. Individual directors undertake other external courses as necessary for professional development. Board Diversity Policy CSi recognises and embraces the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive culture and having a diverse Board. The Board Diversity Policy sets out the approach to diversity on the Board of Directors. A diverse Board will include and make good use of differences in the skills, regional and industry experience, independence and knowledge, background, race, gender and other distinctions between Directors. The Nomination Committee will consider these attributes in determining the optimum composition of the Board and when possible balancing the Board appropri-ately. The Board maintains its initial target of at least 25% female Board representation in 2021 and will continue to monitor the composition in 2022 through periodic reviews of structure, size and performance of the Board. The aforementioned Board responsibilitiesand Board committees comply with the requirements defined in the PRA Rulebook for 'Gen-eral Organisational Requirements', chapter 5 (Management Body). Board Meetings 23 Board meetings were held in 2021 including scheduled Board meetings, ad hoc Board and Board Sub-Committee meetings. Board members also attend extensive briefing sessions to prepare for technical Board discussions. All members of the Board are expected to spend the necessary time outside of these meetings to discharge their responsibilities. The Chair convenes the meetings with sufficient notice and prepares an agenda. The Chair has the discretion to invite management to attend the meetings. The Board also holds separate private sessions without management present. Minutes are kept of the Board meetings. The members of the Board are encouraged to attend all Board and committee meetings on which they serve; ad hoc Board and Board Sub- Committee meetings are usually held with minimum quorum attendance.

CSi recognises the importance of its relationship with all stakeholders and seeks to regularly engage with clients, employees, regulators and shareholders in an open dialogue. The group purpose is complemented by a set of cultural values - IMPACT: Inclusion, Meritocracy, Partnership, Account-ability, Client Focus and Trust. The values have been embedded throughout our people process in CSi and serve as a behavioural guide for all employees. CSi has implemented a strategy, which takes into account the impact of its long-term decisions on its stakeholders and, in doing so, aims to deliver consistent and sustainable profitability. Strategy The CSi strategy is to build on its strengths as a global hub for Credit Suisse derivative products and as a registered swap dealer for Dodd-Frank clients, and to provide its clients with securities and non-securities sales, trading, risk management and settlement services. The strategy is also to provide solutions for other divisions, and businesses, including wealth management clients; and to provide M&A and underwriting and arrangement services, and bilateral or syndicated loans for its corporate clients. The Board held a Strategy and Financial Plan session and worked with management to develop a shared long-term perspective, to define and embed the CSi Purpose and Strategy, and to review    CSi strategic strengths and weaknesses compared with peers, with a focus on client strategy. The Board has also reviewed and approved the 2022 Financial Plan, which underpins the execution of the CSi strategy consistent with CS group strategy. Corporate Responsibility For CSi, corporate responsibility is about creating sustainable value for clients, shareholders, employees and other stakehold-ers.

CSi, as a material legal entity of CS group, regularly engages directly in a dialogue with stakeholders including clients, and employees as well as with regulators, policymakers and Non-Governmental Organisations ('NGO'). This dialogue, combined with the insights gained through its involvement in initiatives, business associations, and forums, as well as through surveys, strengthens CSi's understanding of the different, and sometimes conflict-ing, perspectives of its stakeholders. This helps CSi to identify stakeholders' interests and expectations at an early stage, to offer CSi's own perspective and to contribute to the development of solutions in response to current challenges wherever possible.

Workplace and Employees The Board has supported management with their approach to managing employees in the best way during the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2021, taking an active interest in employee sentiment and return to office strategies.    The Board understands the importance on continuing to make progress on the Group Culture program. The Board receives an update on the culture program twice a year and has participated in further ad-hoc working sessions with a view to familiarising themselves with the new global culture framework launched in January '20'21. The Board had further insights into employee sentiment and perception of culture via presentations on the CSi specific '20'21 global IMPACT survey results, which sought to measure current employee status against our six IMPACT values. The Board has also worked with management to build an inclusive culture reflecting all aspects of diversity but with particular focus on gender parity and black talent. CSi has engaged with employees during the year via forums and channels, listening to its employees to ensure the views needs of its people are taken into account. These channels include employee surveys, town halls, employee networks and via senior management engagement. In addition to formal consultation processes where required, employee feedback is frequently sought and is encouraged. As in '20'20, during '20'21, all CSi employees were consulted on the relaxation of COVID-19 health and safety measures in the working environment for employees. As part of this, they were informed about how to provide feedback and raise issues on an ongoing basis. CSi has a Board iNED responsible for Employee Engagement on behalf of the Board to assist the Board in complying with its Board 'People' objective. The iNED keeps the Board apprised on material employee matters including on key people and culture related insights and trends and is a standing attendee at the UK management culture board. Suppliers CSi, as a material legal entity of CS group, strives to maintain a fair and professional working relationship with its suppliers. CSi considers factors like quality and shared values when forming such relationships and strives to work with those who conduct their businesses responsibly. In addition, CSi has developed a framework to monitor these relationships. It is important for business partners to know how CSi understanding of corporate responsibility affects them. The CS group Supplier Code of Conduct defines the standards relating to business integrity, labour and social aspects, environmental protection and general business principles that CSi expects suppliers to meet. To achieve further progress in the areas of social and environmental respon-sibility, the Supplier Code of Conduct may require suppliers to implement measures that go beyond local laws and regulations. CSi, as a material legal entity of CS group, has introduced the Third Party Risk Management ('TPRM') Framework to manage financial, operational and reputational risks and to meet the increasing regulatory requirements governing business relationships with third parties. CSi assesses potential environmental, social and labour law-related risks, among others, in connection    with third party suppliers. This assessment informs the commercial assessment, negotiations and eventual contract award process. The TPRM Framework also allows CSi to continuously monitor these relationships, to raise and track issues, and to better understand the associated risks and if necessary demand actions for improvement from suppliers and service providers. In addition, CSi management has established a Service Management Framework ('SMF') to ensure that CSi operates an effective risk and control environment across all types of service dependencies, which includes ensuring outsourcing arrangements operate within acceptable risk appetites and meet the FCA/ PRA Outsourcing Rule book ('SYSCB'). In addition, CS Services AG, London Branch ('UK Service Co') is a London branch of CS Services AG, providing UK-based RRP critical services supporting CSi. The UK Service Co reports into the Board of the Zurich based parent. The CSi Board has undertaken a specific review of Corporate Sourcing and Contract Management via its Audit Committee in '20'21. Environment NGOs/lGOs CSi, as a material legal entity of CS group, maintains a dialogue with NGOs, Intergovernmental Organisations ('IGO'), local organisations and other stakeholders to understand their concerns and to address social and environmental issues. CSi, as a material legal entity of CS group, contributes to the public debate on these topics through its publications, initiatives and events. CSi considers this dialogue important since it encourages each party to see key issues from a new perspective and it promotes mutual understanding. Working with partner organisations, CSi strives to contribute to economic and social development. CSi regularly engages with its stakeholders through participation in forums and round tables and joined industry, sector and specific topic debates. Examples include the Equator Principles Associa-tion, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Responsible Business Conduct in the financial sector and the UN Principles on Responsible Banking. Discussions with NGOs centre on topics such as climate change, biodiversity and conservation as well as risks relating to the financing of projects and human rights-related issues. ➔ For an overview of sustainability initiatives and memberships, please refer to: https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/our-company/corporate-respon-sibility/banking/agreements-memberships.html Throughout '20'21, Credit Suisse provided environmentally focussed volunteering opportunities with East London Business Alliance and Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.
