   Corporate governance The Group is subject to many laws, rules and regulations in some of the highest regulated jurisdictions and has consistently satisfied all of its obligations in full across these and other markets wherein it operates. Further, the Group actively participates in many regulated physical and financial market exchanges. The Compliance function ensures that the Group does not breach applicable regulations / sanctions and keeps abreast of regulatory reforms. Gerald's board of directors has considered the revised 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code ("Code"). As the Code is designed for premium listed companies, the Board is of the opinion that other principles and guidelines may be more appropriate for a private company such as Gerald Group. The Board has therefore also considered The Wates Principles and has aligned itself to these governance principles.
