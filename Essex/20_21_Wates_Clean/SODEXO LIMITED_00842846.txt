The board's policies and procedures should support effective decision-making and independent challenge." Accountability The Group has in place a well-developed and embedded global operating framework which sets out Group operating rules, policies, procedures and delegations of authorities. In addition, the Company has established a UK governance framework, aligned to the global operating framework, designed to meet the Company's requirements in the UK.    Board and Executive Team The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to the UK & Ireland Regional Leadership Committee ("RLC") which is representative of the Company's diverse segment businesses and supporting functions.

The Board promotes the purpose of the Company in the region in alignment with the Sodexo Group; ensuring that its values, strategy and culture align with that purpose; provides constructive challenge to the RLC, and oversees the stewardship and accountability of the Company in terms of financial governance and risk management. The RLC meets at least monthly and the Board operates a programme of four scheduled meetings a year, with ad hoc meetings held as and when required. In 2021, the Board met a total of four times. Minutes of decisions and actions are recorded for each meeting. Board meetings are scheduled to follow RLC meetings and the Directors have access to the same key management information.

Financial information is externally audited by KPMG on a half year and full year annual basis. Financial controls, processes and records are reviewed by the Company's centralised internal audit function. Other key information is prepared by the relevant business and internal functions. Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk "The Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company by identifying opportunities to create and preserve value and establish oversight for identification and mitigation of risks." Opportunity The Board and the RLC consider on an annu.al basis the Company's strategic plan, which includes a consideration of long term strategic opportunities (for example, the acquisition of strategic business targets and the development of new services).

Specific working groups were established to address supporting the national COVID-19 response, future business trading and restructuring in accordance with the Group's strategy and Global Efficiency Programme. Principle 5 - Remuneration â€¢~ Board should promote executive remuneration structures aligned to the long-term sustainable success of a company, taking into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company." The Company's compensation policy is an essential lever for profitable growth. Through a balance between individual and collective recognition, long term and short term, it aims to strengthen our culture of performance. The Company's performance based reward and recognition philosophy and policies will help build a performance culture by better differentiating and rewarding individual contributions to collective success. The reward philosophy is based on four pillars: competitive salary, variable and differentiating bonus, discretionary long term incentives, relevant flexible benefits. Benefits are set up and maintained locally. Salary The Company recognises its employees' contribution and the positive behaviours that serve its clients and consumers in order to foster sustainable and profitable growth in accordance with its values. Salaries share the created collective value and are forward looking reflecting expectations and potential, and are benchmarked against a number of industry and geographical external data. Variable performance pay The Company rewards colleagues appropriately with variable performance pay that reflects collective or individual performance being met. Performance is defined and pay can be differentiated for individuals. It is timely and may be on going. Long Term Incentives The Company provides long term incentives, such as Company shares to help retain talent and recognise future leaders. These incentives link individual interests and performance to the those of the Company shareholders.    Benefits Additional Company benefits are designed to provide day to day assistance and help meet long term needs and provided across the Company, determined by local regulations and practices, and to be relevant to local employees. Compensation Framework All compensation and Reward decisions made within Sodexo UK&I should reinforce our commitment to these global key principles and must therefore rely on several compensation fundamentals: â€¢ Job Documentation & Evaluation: Each job above site level should be graded using the Group's Hay-based methodology. Evaluations will be based on written job descriptions including the most recent possible information on the scope and structure of the job, validated by the appropriate dimension HR or Group Talent team member. Salary Structures: Each country should have a confirmed set of salary ranges by grade established collaboratively by Group Reward, Country HR, and Geographic Governance. These ranges will be based on benchmark data sources that must be approved by Group Reward. Approved data sources currently include Hay Group as a primary global provider. Towers-Watson, Aon-Hewitt, and others as validated are used as secondary sources. Market alignment: Midpoints for pay structures will generally align to general industry market medians in each country. Variable Pay Guidelines: Some roles have short term performance incentives (annual incentive payments) and long term incentives (performance shares) that have target minimum and maximum levels established for each grade by Group Reward. These are set as a percentage of base pay based on combined data analysis of market practice in hub locations. There are areas of unionised groups of employees within Sodexo UK&I Principle 6 - Stakeholder Relationships and Engagement "Directors should foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the Company's purpose. The board is responsible for overseeing meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including the workforce, and having regard to their views when taking decisions." As well as outlining how the Company has applied Principle 6 of the Wates Corporate Governance Principles, the Company describes in this section how the directors have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006. In particular, the statement below outlines how the directors have acted in a way which is most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the members as a whole and in doing so having regard for stakeholders' interests. The Board and the RLC are responsible for fostering effective relationships with all its stakeholders, including its clients, employees, suppliers, the UK Government and the wider community. We consider the key stakeholders to be as follows: Employees The Board recognises that, as an integrated facilities management service provider,its employees are key to the CompanyÂ·s strength and success. The Board and the RLC is committed to ensuring: Health & Safety Ongoing support to all employees High levels of employee engagement and communications A diverse and inclusive workforce and culture.    Health & Safety The Company is committed to ensuring a safe and healthy working environment for all its employees, contractors and visitors. Through suitable and sufficient risk assessment and the creation of resulting safe systems of work, Sodexo provides employees with information, training and instruction to enable them to work safely and to protect the safety and health of those who may be affected by its activities. Compliance with legislative requirements underpins its purpose. The Company tests and challenges itself to continually improve and to engage with its people to ensure everyone has a voice and is properly informed. The Company believes that health and safety is everyone's responsibility arid through strong leadership, supervision and holding each other to account, health and safety can become a way of life that adds value and drives improved performance. Management and monitoring of performance is achieved through robust reporting, strong audit and monitoring regimes. Ongoing support to all employees Across Sodexo companies, measures were in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to look after its employees. The business, split fairly evenly across food service and facilities management meant it was able to redeploy employees when some client sites closed, to support healthcare and other government sites. For those colleagues that could not be redeployed, the Government Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was utilised to protect jobs, skills and expertise until sites could reopen. The Company also continue to: promote 'speak', which is a confidential route for staff to raise concerns offer a free helpline where staff can seek expert advice to person and mental wellbeing topics. The Company is proud of all of its teams and their dedication and agility during the pandemic. Employee engagement Regular employee engagement surveys are conducted and results are carefully scrutinised by the RLC to identify and implement actions for improvement. The RLC monitors attrition rates, feedback from exit interviews, and absenteeism levels in an effort to identify emerging people risks, trends, and to ensure appropriate action is taken to address these. Emerging people risks and trends are highlighted to the Board together with proposed action plans. Sodexo conducted a "voice survey" in 2021 as part of its engagement programme. Colleagues' opinions are valuable to help guide strategy and business planning. The engagement score for the UK&I region under the Voice Survey was 65.5%, and globally 78.3%. In October 2019., in line with the World Mental Health Day, the Company launched the Wellbeing Matters campaign across UK&I. The objective was to promote, educate and support colleagues on a range of mental health issues over the upcoming year. New modules were added to the Wellbeing Hub to respond to the new ways of working owing to Covid-19. As at 1 September, over 6,000 colleagues had completed these modules. We strive to create an employee experience that enables our people to belong, act and thrive whilst working for Sodexo. We measure the effectiveness of our "belong, act, thrive" promise by conducting annual global employee engagement surveys* and ad-hoc surveys to address specific areas of the organisation. The data are thematically and statistically analysed to distil an action plan to address feedback solicited through the survey. A communications strategy is then tuned to deepen employee engagement by focusing on informing, engaging and inspiring colleagues to create an effective and inclusive workplace.    Diversity, Equity & Inclusion lnclusivity is a key commitment to ensure colleagues 'can bring their authentic selves to work'. "For Sodexo UK and Ireland it is a strategic priority to foster diversity, equity and inclusion across the organisation. It is not only the right thing to do, it helps drive our business performance too. We are committed to creating a workplace culture that is truly inclusive and where everyone can flourish. " Sean Haley, Region Chair Sodexo UK & Ireland Our DE&I (diversity, equity and inclusion) strategy focuses on five dimensions gender, race and ethnicity, disability, generations and gender identity and sexual orientation and gender identity. Each of these focus areas has an executive sponsor who is a member of the RLC. They play a key role at championing the agenda, driving progress and embedding accountability at a senior level. We have made a number of commitments that will support our aspirations to be a diverse and inclusive organisation across our identified four social impact pathways - people, partners, places and planet. This includes aspirational targets for the representation of women and those from under represented ethnic groups in management and senior leadership positions; commitment to closing the gender pay gap across our legal entities in the UK to 10% by 2025, and initiatives to support women in the community to drive societal change. In July 2021 we were successfully re-accredited as a Disability Confident leader, the highest level of accreditation achievable. This is testament to our long-standing programme of work to support the attraction, retention and development of disabled people into work and play our part in closing the disability employment gap. Clients The company operates a Client Lifecycle approach to monitor and manage all contracts. Client retention is the essential first step in our Focus on Growth strategic agenda that helps create sustainable growth. This is underpinned by our "Clients for Life" programme. It is imperative that we continually seek to listen, understand and meet our client's expectations throughout the client lifecycle to help ensure we never knowingly lose profitable business. Members of the RLC and our operational senior leadership team meet with our key clients at regular intervals to discuss and collaboratively agree the key strategic priorities that both organisations will invest effort and resources in that drives continuous progression of both the strategic partnership and enhances service performance that impacts on our clients, employees and visitors. Detailed client feedback touchpoints are executed by an independent and impartial team that captures client insight from a variety of client key stakeholders at various degrees of proximity to service delivery. This insight is shared across a range of key stakeholders within the Company to ensure that any decisions around service design and architecture places client objectives and needs at the heart of the decision making ..process. Progress is tracked by the board and the UK&I RLC.    Suppliers The Company manages their end to end supply chain to meet legislative requirements, mitigate risks and satisfy customer demands for supply chain transparency. All suppliers of goods and services to Sodexo are prequalified to ensure they are capable and competent to deliver the goods or carry out the work they are being contracted to supply. Vendors are assessed against Sodexo's Supplier Code of Conduct. The level of initial assessment and on going monitoring relates directly to the services/products provided or to be performed and the associated risk. Assessment of vendor suitability is carried out by professionals who are independent from the day to day operational management of the vendors they evaluate. Food suppliers are further audited by Sodexo's Health and Safety division, against our own Supplier Code of Practice. It is essential suppliers strive to meet these standards on a continuous basis as a condition of the supply agreement. Failure to meet the expected standard results in the immediate suspension of trade. If positive action is not taken to remedy the situation, the supplier will be removed from supply chain. The Company is committed to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or any part of its business and has in place measures to manage this risk including risk based audit process. Community Sodexo's approach to creating Social Value and measuring its impact within local communities forms an integral part of the Company's regional strategy. The Company is undergoing a comprehensive programme to fully embed and coordinate its impact on local communities and the environment. This is led by our Regional Leadership Committee. Our focus is based around four social value impact pathways: â€¢ Our People - by enabling our employees, customers and community citizens to thrive â€¢ Our Planet - by fostering a culture of environmental responsibility through protecting and enhancing our planet â€¢ Our Places - by adopting a needs-led approach to creating equity for all across our communities â€¢ Our Partners -by taking an inclusive approach to creating resilience and growth amongst our partner network Further information is set out in the Company's Social Impact Report 2020/21 [https://uk.sodexo.com/social-impact.html] Our Net Zero commitment will be delivered through the social value 'Our Planet' pathway, but will play a part across all four impact pathways. With a baseline of 2017 we met our 34% absolute reduction target, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), in 2021 across scopes 1, 2 and 3. By 2025 we aim to be carbon neutral for our direct operations (scopes 1&2). Followed by our near-term target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all three scopes by 55% by 2030 (SBTi validated). When we talk about all three scopes, we include within that every single component of our business' operations spanning our supply chain, all the way through to our client sites. By no later than 2045 we will have concluded a complete decarbonisation of the business, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by over 90% and neutralising any remaining emissions to reach net zero. Scope 1 emissions relate to those emissions that we make directly, including the fuel we use in our vehicles and the heating of our offices. Scope 2 emissions refer to the indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, such as powering our offices. Scope 3 refers to all other indirect emissions that occur in our value chain, including supply chain, business travel and commuting and client sites.

Sodexo Ltd executives meet regularly with the Pension Trustee, discussing administration of the fund, governance, and both company and fund asset performance. The ongoing liabilities and assets of the fund are monitored closely and Sodexo Ltd makes payment to the fund based on agreed employee and employer contributions. The full actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the fund takes place every 3 years.

Employee and employer contributions in respect of future accrual have been agreed, together with an ongoing contribution to cover fund expenses. There was also a one off funding shortfall payment made to the pension fund of Â£60m in January 2022, with fund liabilities now fully hedged with matching assets. Sodexo Ltd remains fully committed to the support of the Sodexo Pension Fund.
