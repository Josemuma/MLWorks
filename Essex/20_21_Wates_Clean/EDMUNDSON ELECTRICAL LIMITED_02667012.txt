   CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT The Board has considered its governance and has determined to apply the Wates principles. Each year we review our practices against these principles and we will continue to monitor them in the light of future developments in this area. Purpose and Leadership Good governance is essential to the successful delivery of our strategy and the way in which our business operates on a day to day basis. The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards across the Company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is to provide the highest possible service to trade customers. We operate in a multi-branch business with a high level of decentralisation backed up by strong controls and a reward structure that is based on local performance and individual contributions. The ability of our branch managers to determine all aspects of their businesses ensures they are strongly focused on providing the best service to their customers, supporting our key suppliers to get their products to market and employing, retaining and rewarding a high quality team. As a decentralised business we try to take decisions as close to our customers as possible. However, the Board is strongly aware that it has ultimate responsibility for the actions that are taken. It reserves certain key decisions to the Board, such as senior appointments, funding of operations, acquisitions and appointment of auditors. Day to day operations are managed with the oversight of an operational management team comprising the Managing Director and Finance Director, together with senior commercial and regional managers. Minutes of these meetings are provided to all Directors. In addition to the day to day monitoring of operating performance, members of the Board meet with each branch manager once a year for a formal review of the performance of their business and of their plans for the following year by way of a detailed analysis of the business. This is supplemented by a mid-year review of progress to enable adjustments to be made in the light of market developments. All members of the Board, together with the senior management team, actively promote our decentralised philosophy and seek to coach and help the branch managers and their teams to maximise their rewards by considering the consequences of their decisions in the long term. Our values of integrity, fairness, teamwork, hard work and personal responsibility support this and ensure we meet the needs of our customers and suppliers. These are supported by a commitment to the recruitment of high calibre staff and ongoing training and development at all levels.

Remuneration comprises basic salary, which is set in the context of industry norms, pension contributions or equivalent additional salary, company car or salary alternative, medical cover and an annual bonus.
