Corporate governance statement For the year ended 31 December 2021, under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the Company has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for Large Private Companies. The Directors have set out below an explanation of how the Wates Principles have been applied during the year. Principle 1 - Purpose and Leadership The Directors of the Company are considered the Main Board ("Main Board"). The Main Board engages with the wider executive team (''.the Executive Team ") a team that is made up of key leaders in the Company who have accountability and responsibility of a defined operational or compliance role. The Main Board actively engages with the Executive Team in setting the intentions and purpose of the Company. The Company is a unique hotel owner operator. It owns all 33 hotels in the UK and is able to assess full control over its operations. The Company's strategy is to provide customers with a complete 'all-in-one' experience through its exceptional hotel rooms, a food and beverage offering of a pub and grill and a coffee shop and a full leisure facility and gym complete with a swimming pool. It also offers a co-working space in a number of its hotels. The Company champions the wellbeing of its employees and having a positive impact on the communities it operates in. Principle 2 - Leadership composition The Company is a privately owned company. It is not listed on the stock exchange but it does adhere to the principles of good governance to guarantee economic performance, exemplary administration and management, and trust and transparency. The Company has a Corporate Governance Policy that enables it to manage and identify who can report to the Board and can deal more effectively with the challenges ofrunning a company. The intention of the Corporate Governance Policy is to ensure that the business has appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interest of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. It includes the processes by which the Company's objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social regulatory and market environment. It is concerned with practices and procedures for trying to make sure the Company can achieve its objectives but ensure that stakeholders can have confidence that the trust in the Company is well founded. The Company's Senior Executive Team is composed of a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Financial Controller, Director of People and Operations and General Counsel. Members of the Senior Executive Team usually attend Main Board Meetings three times each year as required, and minutes are taken in line with statutory obligations.    The Executive Team meets once a week to discuss performance, risk and highlight areas for discussion. The Executive Team has a diverse range of skills and expertise in the wide range of services offered by the Company from Food & Beverage to Leisure to Sales and Marketing to in-house financial and legal expertise. The Executive Team's size and composition is regarded as appropriate to the Company's complex yet focused business. The Executive Team attends an informal meeting with the Main Board every second month, and in addition members of the Main Board will attend meetings with specific members of the Executive Team to discuss areas of operational significance or risk. Principle 3 - Leadership responsibilities Each member of the Executive Team understands what they are accountable and responsible for and they provide a report each week at the Executive Team meeting. To ensure full transparency a monthly report is sent to the Main Board. The Main Board ultimately retains responsibility for all decision making in business operations and ensures delegated decision makers are individuals with the most experience and relevant knowledge. All members of the Executive Team are required to consider any conflicts or potential conflicts and declare them at least annually to the General Counsel.

A Core Risk Team (comprising General Counsel, Head of Risk and Safety, Internal Audit and Compliance) meets every quarter to review all risks within the business. A Senior Risk Committee (comprising CEO, CFO, General Counsel and Director of People and Operations) meets twice a year. Risk is discussed at Board Meetings with the Main Board and there is an additional risk update provided to the Main Board twice a year outside of the Main Board meeting. Every risk in the business has a mitigation plan / strategy that is reviewed not less than once every six months and identifies risk owners and implementation plans necessary to address each risk. All employees are inducted and continually trained on significant risks including but not limited to life safety and cyber security. The Company engages third party experts to audit fire safety, food safety and IT system security at least annually. The feedback from these audits are shared with the Executive Team.
