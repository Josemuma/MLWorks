The Board comprises two executive Directors (including the Chairman) and two independent non-executive Directors ("independent NEDs"), the latter of which serve limited terms of office and are not selected from former members of the Group to ensure their independence. The Board's size and balance between executive and non-executive Directors is appropriate to facilitate prompt and effective decision making.

These included a more active role in remuneration matters and a deeper insight into risks and risk management via the Audit and Risk Committee.

An additional meeting was also held in July 2020 to review the Group's continuing response to the Covid-19 pandemic. During FY21,there was full attendance at all Reed board meetings and the only conflict of interest declared was a data compliance and governance project with Sagacity Solutions, which Anita Dougall, as a director of that business, had no involvement with. The Board is responsible for establishing the culture, values and framework within which Reed operates, and is responsible to stakeholders for the direction and oversight of the Company to ensure its long-term success. It provides leadership, oversees strategy, ensures the necessary resources are available and sets policies, key operational initiatives and standards. The primary committee of the Board is the Audit and Risk Committee which meets once a quarter. This committee is chaired by independent NED, Clifford Tompsett, who has extensive experience of financial reporting and risk management and can appropriately challenge and influence the Board. The Audit & Risk Committee supports the Board by reviewing the comprehensiveness and reliability of assurances on governance, risk management, control environment, and the integrity of Reed's financial statements and annual report. Reed has increased its reliance on data and recognises the importance of accurate and relevant information, driving its investment in a new system for data interrogation and reporting. Board members receive regular and timely business reports from each business on areas such as financial performance, strategy, operations and environmental impact, each supported by Key Performance Indicators to keep the Board informed of Reed's performance, position and long-term sustainable success.

The Board, with assistance from the Audit and Risk Committee, has oversight on how risk is managed and responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks the Company is facing, the overall risk appetite, and for Reed's internal control framework.    The Group has developed robust procedures to identify, monitor and manage risk via a Risk Assurance Committee, which meets quarterly and receives reports from the subsidiary companies on any emerging or established risks which are considered to have an impact on stakeholders or may impact Reed's business objectives. During 2021 the Group appointed a Risk and Governance Manager to support it in developing its evolving procedures to identify, monitor and manage risk. Reed has an in-house audit function which provides assurance to the Board, via the Audit and Risk Committee, about the effectiveness of internal controls, risk management and governance processes. RSR and Reed in Partnership hold certifications approaches to risk management.

For co-members, Reed collects monthly survey results across all subsidiary companies, operates idea initiatives, as well as having whistleblowing processes in place as routes for anonymous feedback to be reported. There is also two-way communication via the Chairman's online blog and new digital communication routes have also been established utilising Microsoft Yammer as a quick and accessible channel for questions, discussions and feedback.

Board Directors directly oversaw the refurbishment of Reed's Northampton 900 freehold facility, engaging with co-members via working groups and surveys to optimise key operational elements of the building, and directly engaged with corporate bankers regarding potential financing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Directors also engaged directly with shareholders to agree that a FY21 dividend would not be paid. Reed's overall position and future prospects are assessed within the going concern basis of the Directors' Report.    Wates Variations Reed has applied the Wates Corporate Governance Principles in compliance with its corporate governance obligations under The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018. We expect there to be continued evolution in the oversight of risk during the upcoming financial year to allow for the further enhancement of its identification, monitoring and management processes.
