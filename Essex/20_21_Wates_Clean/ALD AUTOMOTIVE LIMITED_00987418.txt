Purpose and Leadership The Board takes full responsibility for the success of ALO which incorporates responsibilities for the management of the culture, values and wider standards of ALD including its commitment to diversity, community engagement, social responsibility and environmental sustainability.

To that end, the Board plays a role in monitoring the culture and values of ALD so as to ensure that they align with the wider Group strategy, discussed further in the Strategic Report. Board Composition ALD's Board is made up of Tim Laver (Managing Director) and Ian Turner with Anna Woodward as company secretary. The Operating Board Committee support the Board.

The current size of the board is considered appropriate to the scale and complexity of the Company.    Directors' Responsibilities The directors have a responsibility to act at all times in the best interests of ALO and steer it towards achieving its strategic objectives.

A deep understanding of SMCR and its requirements was embedded across ALO (particularly to those performing controlled functions and falling under the certification regime) via a targeted training campaign. The Board operates three tiers of committees which ultimately feed back into the Operating Board Committee and the Board. The first tier is occupied by the Executive Risk Committee with the second tier being occupied by the following sub-committees: Operational Risk Committee, Customer & Conduct Committee, Maintenance Committee, Residual Value Committee and the Treasury Committee. The third tier is occupied by the Information Governance Committee and the CSR Management Committee. In accordance with Societe Generale requirements, ALO operates a standalone Internal Control Co-ordination Committee which forms part of Societe Generale's audit toolkit for the wider Group. The directors receive timely and regular information on various issues relevant to ALO both in and outside Board meetings.    Opportunity and Risk    The Board is responsible for the strategic direction of ALO. Any changes in the ALD's operating environment which could lead to opportunities and risks are considered by the Board (and the relevant board committee where appropriate) in regular Board meetings and appropriate plans of action are put in place which balance opportunity against risks. This ensures that ALD has the best chance for future success an~ is able to generate value for all its stakeholders. The Board has implemented policies which encourage an efficient and effective controls framework which identifies and minimises risk in a timely manner. Once identified, risks are managed through appropriate management delegation with regular reporting to the Board. Further details around risks have been specified in note 22.
