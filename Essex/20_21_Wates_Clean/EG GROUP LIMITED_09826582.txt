BUILDING A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK THAT IS FIT FOR PURPOSE In order to ensure that the Board makes the right decisions for the Company and its stakeholders, it is vital that we have good corporate governance in place. During 2021, we developed our governance framework with the appointment of a Non-Executive Chairman and independent Non-Executive Director and throughout 2022, we will continue to review and build up on our processes and systems. The Board is primarily responsible for agreeing strategy, overseeing performance and ensuring financial processes and internal controls. and challenging appropriate To do this effectively, the Board established three non-executive-lead Committees - Nomination, Audit & Risk and Remuneration, each chaired by an independent Non-Executive Director. The roles and responsibilities of the Committees are set out in their Terms of Reference and further details around key decisions, achievements and priorities can be found in the Committee reports on pages 80 to 89. Whilst a number of activities and responsibilities have been delegated to the Committees, the Board maintains oversight and overall responsibility of key areas, which are detailed in the matters    reserved.    In additi9n, a number of Executive Management Committees, or working groups, have been established to ensure effective information flows between the business, the Group's Co-CEOs and the Board. These include Senior and Country Leadership Meetings, the Executive Risk & Disclosure Committee, Health & Safety Committees, Works Councils and a Learning & Development Committee. A disciplined reporting structure ensures the Board is appropriately appraised on activities, opportunities and risks in order to provide strategic direction. The Group's General Counsel and Company Secretary provides regular updates in relation to changing regulatory, legislative and governance requirements. The Board keeps all aspects of corporate governance under review and will continue to develop in line with the Group. Composition Composition of the Board changed significantly during 2021 with the appointment of Lord Stuart Rose as Chairman of the Board and Dame Alison Carnwath an independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee. Stuart and Alison joined fellow independent Non-Executive Director John Carey, Non-Executive Directors and TOR Representatives Manjit Dale and Gary Lindsay and Executive Directors Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa. Details of the Directors' biographies and committee membership can be found on pages 72 and 73 and details of all Directors' skills and backgrounds can be found on page 75. The current size, composition and diversity of the Board is sufficient for the size, scale and complexity of the Group and the skills and knowledge aligns with the growing diversity of the Group's portfolio and future strategic objectives. There is appropriate representation from the Group's ultimate shareholder and the addition of the independent Non-Executive Directors facilitates independence and constructive challenge. Induction During the first half of 2021, the newly appointed Non-Executive Directors undertook a detailed and tailored induction. Meetings were arranged virtually, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, with the existing members of the Board, Executive Management and Country Management Teams. In-person meetings were held at the Group's head office and in the USA once permitted and teach-in sessions were arranged. Service agreements are in place for the Non-Executive Directors detailing roles and responsibilities and expected time commitment.    Skills The criteria for appointment focused on ensuring the Board had the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, competence, diversity and independence. The workings and skills of the Board will remain under close review via the Nomination Committee (see page 80) to ensure any gaps are identified and resolved. Details of the Directors' knowledge and previous experience can be found in the table below.

Senior Leadership Meeting is convened to discuss any pertinent matters.    Time commitments and independence Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to provide minimum time commitment which is stipulated in their service contracts; however, throughout 2021 and 2022 and due to the volatility of the markets, they continue to make themselves available at short notice to deal with matters as they arise. All Directors are required to report any external appointments the Group Company Secretary; a list of appointments is maintained by the Group Secretariat and reviewed annually. Stuart Rose, Alison Carnwath and John Carey were deemed independent on appointment. They assess, challenge and monitor the Executive Directors' delivery of strategy within the risk and governance framework agreed by the Board and, following advice and guidance from the Audit & Risk Committee, review the integrity of the Group's financial information. The Board therefore considers them to be independent in both character and judgement. a to As Executive Directors, co-founders and shareholders, and Zuber Issa, alongside TOR Representative Directors Dale and Gary Lindsay, are not deemed independent.
