Opportunity and Risk Opportunity To create and preserve long term value the Board is always considering new opportunities that would work well with our existing model and fit with our culture. To this end we are growing our vending business and we are planning on opening more pods in supermarket carparks as this has proven to be a very successful model for us. Covid has also highlighted the increased need for online shopping from people spending more time at home. We are therefore developing our digital footprint to make our services more accessible to more people. Risk The Board considers the risk of cyber threat to be high given consumer's recent reliance on technology and the shift towards online activity brought about by COVID-19. Cyber crime can happen easily and quickly with massive detrimental impact on cash and the ability to trade. To combat this risk the business is investing heavily in back up data centres and in-house resources to implement IT security products. Our colleagues are encouraged to be vigilant and remain aware to minimise the risk of exposure.

Our carbon footprint is covered in more detail in the SECR on page 13. Stakeholders The Board takes the views of all of its stakeholders into account when making decisions. The opinions of customers, suppliers, colleagues, the wider community and the impacts on the environment are important when determining the strategic direction of the company.
